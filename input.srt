1
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:06,216
You haven’t changed.

2
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:08,669
I learnt that from you.

3
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,685
Stop.. Stop..

4
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:24,865
Stop.. stop..

5
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:28,685
Stop! Stop!

6
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:35,224
Hello.. control room.

7
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:49,127
I can bet Rs.10, 000. They won’t catch up with me. -Game.

8
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:05,755
I told you they wouldn’t be able to catch up with us.
Ten thousand…

9
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:16,380
What happened to your bet?

10
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:22,026
It’s my turn to bet Rs. 10,000.
These policemen will escort us.

11
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:24,294
What? -Get out of the car.

12
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:26,372
How dare you speed away without stopping?
Are you drunk?

13
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,037
I don’t drink. -Blow!!

14
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:29,357
Blow it properly.

15
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:38,037
What’s this, sir? Will you kill me?
Won’t you help an innocent?

16
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:40,482
Look at him...
he’s critical. I’m taking him to the hospital.

17
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:41,943
He can’t even move his limbs.

18
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:44,308
Look at him, sir.

19
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:46,497
Did you see that? If anything happens to him,

20
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:49,282
I’ll tell the media that you are responsible.

21
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:51,693
No, sir. Please check. I’ll go only after that.

22
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,482
Go away! -No, sir. Please check. I’ll go only after that.

23
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:56,490
Go away. Leave! Why are you dragging it?

24
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:58,513
Get into the car, Take him to the hospital.

25
00:04:59,086 --> 00:04:59,997
Hey, bring the car.

26
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,052
Are they escorting us?

27
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:11,021
I suggest, we’ll go ahead.
You follow us. We’ll clear the road for you.

28
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:14,138
Is that okay? -Yes.

29
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,365
Good, Just follow us.

30
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:19,099
Turn on the siren, sir.

31
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:21,216
Hey, turn on the siren.

32
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:23,451
Stop. They left.

33
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:28,279
You acted very well. -Learnt it from you, right?

34
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,021
I win 20,000. -Alright.

35
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:37,427
I just have one childhood wish...
-To be escorted by the cops. It’s finally fulfilled.

36
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:11,557
The inspector is coming. -What?

37
00:08:11,646 --> 00:08:12,627
The inspector is coming!

38
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:16,883
Is he all right? -Ok sir..

39
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:20,003
Bring a stretcher?
-Please don’t trouble yourself.
I will manage

40
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,090
Just one man like you can make a
difference to the police force…

41
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:28,578
Actually that's my job.. -Please carry on. I will manage.

42
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:29,620
Take care.

43
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:38,745
What do we do now?

44
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:42,182
-I will decide that.

45
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,721
Lingam Uncle...

46
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:31,424
How are you uncle.. -Hey.. hey.

47
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:34,795
You’ve no clue how much I missed you.
-Inside the jail?

48
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:37,566
I was told that I’ve been given a ‘role’. What is it?

49
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:40,182
Yes, you’ve been given the ‘role’ of ‘Kattappa’
in the movie ‘Baahubali 2’.

50
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:41,643
Don’t make fun of me.

51
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,502
You have been released on ‘parole’.

52
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:47,596
You’ve been sentenced to two years of imprisonment.

53
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:50,690
I’ve battled the last six months
to get you a 4-month parole.

54
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:53,229
These four months, You must maintain good conduct.

55
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:56,112
Can you explain it in Telugu?

56
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:59,041
I am speaking in Telugu, right?

57
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:02,043
Good conduct as in well mannered.

58
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:07,923
Henceforth, you must do good to the society
and prove that you’re harmless.

59
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:10,534
The court will close your case
if they believe that you’ve changed.

60
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:12,580
What if they don’t believe?
-You’ll be sent back to jail.

61
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,323
Back to jail. No way! I will listen to you.

62
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:21,526
Hey, Srinu... -You’re hopeless gang is here.

63
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,479
Hey, Srinu...

64
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:25,909
You’re a hero, dude. -What’s all this?

65
00:10:26,363 --> 00:10:28,043
Because you’ve been released from the jail.

66
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,523
So much for coming back from the prison.
Felicitations and cheers!

67
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:32,443
Uncle, come here. -I’m coming.

68
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:41,778
Go..

69
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:06,216
That’s irrelevant. You must tell me.

70
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:08,317
Where has mother gone?

71
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:09,903
She hasn’t gone yet. She is alive.

72
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:38,363
Where are you going?

73
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:43,644
I’ve told you so many times
not to be in the company of those boys.

74
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,156
Who are you to question me?

75
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:47,497
Are you trying to act big
because you are my older brother?

76
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:48,997
Have you forgotten that you’ve just come out of jail?

77
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:50,606
Don’t lecture me.

78
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:09,849
Swathi? -Mother.. Mother’s here. I’ll call you back

79
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:29,950
Why did you come back?

80
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,251
I thought you would go away.

81
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,740
Why did you come back?

82
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:38,974
I believed you would change
and take over my responsibilities.

83
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,372
You shattered my belief six months back.

84
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:43,950
We’ve got used to the idea of living a life without you.

85
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,956
It never occurs to you that
you have a brother and sister…

86
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,067
Your sister…

87
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,896
Sorry… My Daughter.

88
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:57,935
Nobody wants to marry my daughter
because her brother went to prison.

89
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:01,981
Your brother is disobedient just like you.
He is whiling away time on the roadside.

90
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:08,428
I am scared thinking of things
that could happen because you are around.

91
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:10,872
Go away.

92
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:13,630
Mother...

93
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:21,302
We don’t need you here.
Leave now.

94
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:46,164
Are you drinking because you’ve been released from the jail?
Or because your mother disowned you?

95
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:47,302
Give us some clarity.

96
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:49,935
What the hell is wrong with my mother?

97
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:51,575
Why does she expect me to be like her?

98
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:56,591
She wakes up early, does all the work at home,
packs her lunch and goes to work.

99
00:13:56,892 --> 00:14:04,833
She has to salute all her superiors at work.
She is exhausted when she returns home.

100
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:08,536
At the end of the month,
she has no money left even for her bus fare.

101
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:09,856
How can one lead a life like that?

102
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:11,950
I don’t understand how they can live such a life?

103
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:18,083
If the police hadn’t caught us,
our lives would have been different.

104
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:27,638
You can be charged for drinking in a public place.

105
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:30,833
Your parole will be cancelled
and you have to serve extra time in the jail.

106
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:33,724
Where are you? -I am on Google.

107
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,724
I will call you tomorrow. Wind up and leave.

108
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:41,484
Where do I go?

109
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:51,646
Have you brought me to an orphanage because
I have been thrown out of my house?

110
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:58,013
This orphanage is for little children.
Not for grownups like you.

111
00:14:58,852 --> 00:14:59,458
Come along.

112
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:02,518
What should I do here?
-They need a volunteer to look after the children.

113
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:07,531
If you do some good deeds, the court will close your case.

114
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:09,388
Good conduct, remember?

115
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:11,974
You’ve an interview now. Let’s go.
-An interview? Yeah.

116
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:15,893
Tell me? -Here’s the nice guy
I was talking to you about.

117
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:18,373
What were you doing before this?

118
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:19,614
I got out of jail only yesterday.

119
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,536
Didn’t you tell him?

120
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:32,036
Why did you tell him that you were in jail?
-You asked me to maintain good conduct, right?

121
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,364
I’m diabetic. I can’t take this!

122
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:38,091
Where are we going next?

123
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:43,185
You must wake up at 5 in the morning. -That early?

124
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,563
Listen to me...

125
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:48,316
You have to wake him up by 6 am
and get him ready by 7am.

126
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:48,927
Let's go.

127
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:57,084
At 11 pm…

128
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,974
Wait, When do I go to sleep?

129
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,239
Good Question, I will show you the bedroom.

130
00:16:02,264 --> 00:16:05,864
Will I have my own bedroom?
-Yes, we shall provide with attached bathroom, come..

131
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:11,552
You call this a bedroom.
-Yes.

132
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:14,101
That is the bed and this is the room.

133
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,130
That’s the bathroom.

134
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:25,700
Do you like it?

135
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:33,339
You look like a ‘Clean India’ evangelist.
What happened?

136
00:16:33,723 --> 00:16:36,607
This is a very difficult job.
Being in jail is easier.
Over there I have 10 people to work for me.

137
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:39,271
But here, I have to do 10 men’s work.
This won’t work out.

138
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:42,295
Find me a job where I have to work for just one person.
You have the nerve to be choosy?

139
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:45,037
Uncle, where are we going?

140
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:49,162
You asked me to look for one person, right?
I found one.

141
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:52,006
But you won’t fit the cadre.

142
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:55,365
Who are you do decide that? Let’s just go there.

143
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,748
Uncle... -Yes.

144
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,255
This is my thing. -yeah, right!

145
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,662
I can do this for 4 years and not 4 months.

146
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:16,529
Go inside..

147
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,724
How do they make so much money?

148
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:40,490
They fired so many people at once?

149
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:42,584
I stand no chance.

150
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,009
I should definitely get this job.

151
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:47,013
Hey, Who is he?

152
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:49,228
You don’t know him? -No.

153
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:53,074
Vikramaditya, A leading businessman. In fortune 500...
-That’s enough.

154
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:55,868
Who is that girl who followed him inside?

155
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:57,423
That’s his secretary.

156
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:02,072
Where can we find such girls?
I don’t get to see any on the road.

157
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:04,619
She is mine.

158
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,515
I meant the job. -The job is mine.

159
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,345
Rambabu.. -Sir.

160
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,017
Good morning sir..

161
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:18,041
Why did you choose this job?

162
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:22,973
My blood group is O Positive.
Helping people is in my blood.

163
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:27,478
I haven’t kept a photo of my mother in my house.
I’ve only hung a photo of Mother Theresa.

164
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:30,543
A lot of people have said that
they feel a ‘positive vibration’ around me.

165
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,408
Sudhakar.

166
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:33,492
Why did you choose this job?

167
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,579
I’ve been nursing a 90 years old man.

168
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:40,127
He’s passed away last week.
He said he’d miss me before he died.

169
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:43,892
He said life would be good if one had
someone like me for company.

170
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:47,963
I am soft-hearted.
I’ve also done my M.B.A.

171
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:51,236
I can also manage your business.

172
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:52,728
What is your ambition?

173
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:53,315
Money.

174
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:54,619
Humanitarianism.

175
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,431
Service.

176
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:26,314
Sridhar.. -Sir.

177
00:20:26,771 --> 00:20:28,736
Wait. How long should I wait here?

178
00:20:29,404 --> 00:20:30,259
Where do these guys come from!

179
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:45,634
Why did you choose this job?

180
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:51,845
I liked the house at first sight and
I also liked you at first sight.

181
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:03,861
Have you done this kind of work earlier?
-Do you mean social service?

182
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:11,448
I was 4. I nursed an injured dog on
the road and gave some food.

183
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:15,627
I donated blood on Powerstar’s birthday.
I donated my friend’s eyes on Superstar’s birthday.

184
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:20,845
I donated food on Rebelstar’s birthday.
I just donated something at an orphanage.

185
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,134
I’d never say all that.

186
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:28,816
Uncle Lingam is insisting that
I maintain good conduct and that’s why I’m here.

187
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,166
What’s your ambition?

188
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:34,377
I don’t have any big ambition.
I have a different one every day.

189
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:37,033
Today, my ambition is to woo her.

190
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:41,025
Can I have your phone number?

191
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:43,197
Oh.. it's alright.

192
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:45,900
Here’s my number.

193
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:51,745
I’ve free outgoing after 10. I’ll call you back
if you give me a missed call.

194
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:54,517
See ya!

195
00:21:57,336 --> 00:21:58,119
What’s your name?

196
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:02,627
Srinu. -You’ve always been dependable.

197
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:05,197
Yes, Just like you.

198
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:08,898
What are you talking. Do you have sense?

199
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:11,986
You’ll say whatever you want?
Do you have any sense? Idiot.

200
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:13,322
You are appointed.

201
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:18,502
What? -You can join tomorrow.

202
00:22:29,688 --> 00:22:30,822
Hey! Who are you?

203
00:22:31,112 --> 00:22:31,798
Where are you going?

204
00:22:32,345 --> 00:22:33,259
Who are you?

205
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:37,627
I’ve been the chief servant
of this mansion for 30 years.

206
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:39,323
A servant?

207
00:22:39,865 --> 00:22:41,502
I was worried if you were the owner.

208
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:43,939
You are late on your very first day at work!

209
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:48,673
Who is this fellow?
He is the new caretaker appointed by the boss.

210
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:49,916
This fellow!

211
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:51,486
Come along.

212
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:55,416
Go and get a strong cup of coffee for me. -Get lost!

213
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:59,017
You have to wake up at 6
every morning and get ready.

214
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:00,658
Wake up the boss at 7 am and serve him coffee.

215
00:23:00,892 --> 00:23:02,403
His physiotherapist will be here at 8 am sharp.

216
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:05,443
Learn all the exercises from the physiotherapist.
It will be your job from now on.

217
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:07,838
You have to serve breakfast at 9 am.

218
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,408
Breakfast? I already had mine.

219
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,814
Have this walkie-talkie with you.

220
00:23:16,497 --> 00:23:19,095
You’ll be able to hear his instructions here.

221
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:21,056
You must react in no time.

222
00:23:22,937 --> 00:23:24,205
There is one more important thing
that I have to say.

223
00:23:24,643 --> 00:23:25,173
What is it?

224
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:27,447
Don’t waste your time following me around.

225
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,728
Meenakshi said the
same thing when I met her first.

226
00:23:31,363 --> 00:23:32,869
Who is Meenakshi? -My ex-girlfriend.

227
00:23:36,175 --> 00:23:36,994
This is your room.

228
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:45,119
Is this my room?

229
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:48,345
You have to keep the room clean and in order. -Ok.

230
00:23:50,736 --> 00:23:52,134
This is your bathroom.

231
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:05,463
This looks like the ones
I’ve seen in the Hollywood movies.

232
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:07,627
Come, let us go and meet the boss.

233
00:24:08,518 --> 00:24:09,830
Give me 2 minutes. -Ok, hurry up.

234
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:18,908
Why are you looking at me?

235
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:26,713
Thank you. That’s an awesome bathroom.

236
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:32,098
What are you doing?

237
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,908
I didn’t know he is a quadriplegic.
Thought it was only his legs.

238
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:41,014
Sir, I don’t think this fellow will last a week.

239
00:24:41,353 --> 00:24:42,923
Why are you wasting your time on him?

240
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:47,001
Looking at some people, you just wish you could
spend the rest of your life here.

241
00:24:49,516 --> 00:24:52,541
My job is to just take care of you. Right?
Why is she making a big fuss?

242
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:54,580
You will understand as time goes by.

243
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:59,403
Fold.. Stretch... watch carefully.

244
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:02,923
Every bone and muscle of your body must move.

245
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,877
You must not forget that.
He must exercise in the morning and evening.

246
00:25:07,111 --> 00:25:09,869
Without fail. And be very careful, okay?

247
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,275
Did you get it?

248
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:16,009
Hey!

249
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,228
After hands... -I was doing the legs now. Not hands.

250
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,959
Did you notice how she is doing?

251
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:26,861
I saw everything.
-Make him sit on the wheelchair.

252
00:25:32,192 --> 00:25:32,861
Lift him up.

253
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:51,423
Anything else?

254
00:25:57,193 --> 00:25:58,556
Buckle him up.

255
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:04,736
You should have been careful.
-How would I know? You should have told me.

256
00:26:05,074 --> 00:26:07,205
Give him a bath.

257
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:09,056
What did you say? -Give him a bath.

258
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:11,111
I can’t give him a bath.

259
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:19,267
What next?

260
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:22,244
These regulate the blood circulation in his legs.

261
00:26:22,384 --> 00:26:24,494
I gave him a bath. My work ends there.
I can’t do all this.

262
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,697
Keerthi, he will do it.
You leave.

263
00:26:27,783 --> 00:26:31,947
You can’t expect me to do everything just because
you’ve given me a luxurious bathroom.

264
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:45,806
It's alright.

265
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:51,580
Thanks.

266
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:55,723
Uncle, you didn’t tell me before.
Must brush his teeth, give him a shower, oil his hair.

267
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:57,963
I can’t do all that. Look for something else.
-Hey, idiot.

268
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:00,236
Almost everybody has rejected you.

269
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,241
I wonder how he liked you. Bear with it for four months.

270
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:09,064
After yoru case is closed, I’ll talk to Anwar
from Sharjah and fix up something for you.

271
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:10,424
I’m at the court. Hang up now.

272
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:11,844
Hello.. hello..

273
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:15,509
4 months?

274
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,913
Srinu.. Srinu...

275
00:27:19,962 --> 00:27:21,882
Srinu.. Srinu...

276
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:23,306
Srinu.. -What, sir?

277
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:24,243
I want water.

278
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,884
Good morning, sir. -Good morning.

279
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:44,057
Hey.. Srinu!

280
00:27:48,673 --> 00:27:50,658
Must send that to the lawyer, Keep it in the brown file.

281
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:54,470
That’s personal. Keep it in the black one.

282
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,088
What are you doing?

283
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:21,111
It’s so hot and he can’t feel a thing.

284
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:22,908
Idiot.

285
00:28:23,252 --> 00:28:25,482
Are you playing with me?

286
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:27,158
Can’t you feel anything, sir?

287
00:28:37,488 --> 00:28:41,208
Hello.. Okay, I’ll call back later.

288
00:28:42,703 --> 00:28:43,267
Sir..

289
00:28:44,033 --> 00:28:47,322
Calling you sir feels like I’m back to school.
And I always hated school.

290
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:49,213
Usually I call everyone with some relation.

291
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:51,759
Can I call you...
-What do you wanna call me?

292
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,252
Can I call you brother?

293
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,603
What’s this, brother?

294
00:29:08,689 --> 00:29:09,861
Where do such girls live?

295
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,822
Paris. -Did you ever go?

296
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,392
Many times. It’s my favourite city.

297
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:20,353
Whenever I felt stressed I’d escape to Paris.

298
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,890
Get me a bottle of alcohol when you go next time.

299
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:31,353
You’ve so many cars parked here.

300
00:29:31,877 --> 00:29:32,994
Which one should we hop into?

301
00:29:33,345 --> 00:29:35,642
We’re not going in a car. We are taking the van.

302
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:38,814
This is not a van. It’s an ambulance.

303
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:40,861
You’re not a patient to commute in that.

304
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:45,447
Doctors say that
it’s not right for me to commute in a car.

305
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:50,737
You rich people, listen to your doctors and babas.

306
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:54,456
I’m not up for an ambulance. Choose a car!

307
00:29:54,688 --> 00:29:55,767
Which car do you like?

308
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:05,409
Why does it sound like that, brother? -Go on.

309
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:13,275
I’m scared what he’ll do next.

310
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:40,517
It’s been an hour. How long willl you stare
at a white board with red paint, brother?

311
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,009
That painting is talking to me, Srinu.

312
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:47,392
I can’t hear anything.

313
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:49,697
Do you know the greatness of art?

314
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:54,119
You must tell me..
-It remains even after we’re dead and gone.

315
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:58,259
Stop it, brother. The only thing that’ll
remain is a photo frame hanging on the wall.

316
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:00,978
what’s the price? -20 Lakhs.

317
00:31:01,664 --> 00:31:02,304
What?

318
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:05,095
He bought a painting worth 20 Lakhs.

319
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:08,197
Just imagine the number of pegs
I’d get in the same amount.

320
00:31:09,223 --> 00:31:10,627
Hang up. I need to go.

321
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:12,064
Hello..

322
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:20,072
Hi, Vikram. -Hi.

323
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:23,786
Sorry. I’m late.
-It’s a routine for lawyers, right?

324
00:31:24,123 --> 00:31:27,713
I'm not here as your company’s legal advisor.
-You had something important to say.

325
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,233
You selected someone I believe.

326
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:32,470
You liked him of all you interviewed?

327
00:31:33,585 --> 00:31:36,525
He spilled hot water on your legs
to check if you can feel it.

328
00:31:36,865 --> 00:31:38,658
Stupid fellow.  Do you know who he is?

329
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:42,103
A thief. He’s out on parole.

330
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:51,955
They are not kind and compassionate.

331
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:55,873
What if he harms you flee away, we’d be helpless.

332
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:59,478
You know your condition, right?
You should have given it a thought.

333
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,431
That’s it? Or there’s more?

334
00:32:04,735 --> 00:32:07,947
It’s been 5 years since the accident.

335
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:12,881
Why do you all pity my life on wheelchair?

336
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:15,314
I can’t take it.

337
00:32:16,154 --> 00:32:17,033
It’s annoying.

338
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:21,775
Whatever you just said to me was also out of pity.

339
00:32:23,113 --> 00:32:25,119
Exactly, he doesn’t pity me.

340
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:27,875
I want that.

341
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:34,656
He asks me to talk on the phone
and completely ignores that I’m paralysed.

342
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:37,359
I don’t care about his past.

343
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:42,377
I need someone like him in my life right now.

344
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,968
You were saying something? About him harming me...

345
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:52,383
I’ve no hopes from my life anymore.

346
00:32:53,177 --> 00:32:55,805
Why would I fear that
he will do something to me.

347
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,109
You never listen to me anyway.

348
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:04,027
In this world, he is of no use to anyone except you.

349
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,894
Srinu.

350
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:11,158
Brother?

351
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:13,944
Srinu, meet my best friend Prasad.

352
00:33:16,232 --> 00:33:18,667
Sir, I think I’ve seen you before.

353
00:33:21,402 --> 00:33:24,058
You’re an antagonist from Hindi dubbed films, right?

354
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:33,105
See you, sir.

355
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:34,980
Stupid fellow.

356
00:33:38,855 --> 00:33:42,980
I’ve decided today, brother.
All you need is money to live the way you want.

357
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:43,612
What?

358
00:33:43,824 --> 00:33:47,923
Look, your hands and legs don’t work.
Still you’re living life king size

359
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:49,753
That’s the power of money.

360
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:56,003
A painting worth 20 lakhs. That’s life!

361
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:25,511
Hey, you think I can’t do it. Now, look here.

362
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:30,933
Sorry.

363
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,995
Brother.

364
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,854
Brother, what happened?

365
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:14,675
Nothing will happen...

366
00:35:23,342 --> 00:35:25,995
Nothing will happen, brother.

367
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,878
Brother..

368
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:54,401
I can’t breathe.

369
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:58,737
Get me out of here.

370
00:36:10,996 --> 00:36:14,915
Where are we going?
-You wanted to get out, right?

371
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:19,620
I meant to the lawn.

372
00:36:20,323 --> 00:36:23,065
You breathe that air all the time.
-Where are you taking me now?

373
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:38,800
They don’t sell that.

374
00:36:40,252 --> 00:36:42,815
I’m scared you’ll ask its price.

375
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,182
What happened to you before?

376
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:47,778
It’s a minor medical issue.
-A medical problem?

377
00:36:48,065 --> 00:36:51,636
Stop it, brother.
You’d feel that way if you sit in the house all the time.

378
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:57,971
You must go out sometimes.
Not just salads you must eat dum biriyani too.

379
00:37:02,812 --> 00:37:05,511
Not just AC cars you must go on bike rides too.

380
00:37:07,697 --> 00:37:08,964
Me? One  a bike?

381
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:11,526
You can’t hop on?

382
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:17,339
Let’s exchange our vehicles for 30 minutes

383
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,495
Brother, shall we ride?

384
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:35,081
You must also get a bike like this. -What?

385
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,964
You must get a bike..

386
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:38,721
only then will I get a chance..

387
00:38:29,121 --> 00:38:32,604
Your eyes are watering because of the
wind against your face.

388
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:36,854
That’s not why my eyes are watering.

389
00:40:43,624 --> 00:40:44,124
That is personal.

390
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:49,578
Did you paint? -Yes, brother. I painted it.

391
00:42:49,874 --> 00:42:54,514
You paid 20 lakhs for one colour.
I used so many here. I might get 2 lakhs at least.

392
00:42:55,862 --> 00:42:59,400
What were you thinking?
-An artist doesn’t reveal what he feels.

393
00:42:59,574 --> 00:43:01,058
The viewer must understand that.

394
00:43:02,936 --> 00:43:04,056
How is the painting?

395
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:08,578
I couldn’t find the toilet brush. Did you take it?

396
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,457
Get lost!

397
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:14,841
it’s like you painted it with your face.

398
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,097
Place it at the entrance. It’ll purge away evil’s eye.

399
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:19,203
A painter who can’t handle his pants!

400
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:26,394
He’s like a flower to my stem. Hello?

401
00:43:26,419 --> 00:43:29,399
Anwar called me from Sharjah this morning.
He got me a job there.

402
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:32,466
I must go away once the case is closed.
You better take care of the arrangements.

403
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:36,043
Why are you in a hurry?
-I’ll exhaust my balance. Recharge my mobile for Rs. 500

404
00:43:38,003 --> 00:43:38,911
One spicy omelette.

405
00:43:39,026 --> 00:43:42,441
Are you leaving? -Not right now, After 3 months.

406
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:46,559
Vikram, you’re trying to me avoid me.

407
00:43:46,976 --> 00:43:51,776
But I can’t forget you and
I know you can’t forget me either.

408
00:43:52,003 --> 00:43:53,963
Oh, no!

409
00:43:54,546 --> 00:43:57,184
Look. All you need is money. -Ah?

410
00:43:57,793 --> 00:44:00,895
I was wondering why isn’t she falling for me.
Now you know.

411
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:04,017
What? -Didn’t you hear that? Kirthi is hitting on him.

412
00:44:04,348 --> 00:44:06,538
You’ve no control on what you say.
Do you have sense?

413
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:09,473
She’s reading his letter.

414
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:10,997
What?

415
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,333
A letter? -Yes. A letter.

416
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:15,923
The blue one, the personal one.

417
00:44:16,017 --> 00:44:16,372
The same one.

418
00:44:16,652 --> 00:44:17,528
What’s the matter?

419
00:44:23,972 --> 00:44:27,412
Promise me you won’t tell anyone.

420
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:28,583
Tell me quickly.

421
00:44:31,657 --> 00:44:34,857
He visits these art exhibitions very often, right?

422
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:41,769
He liked a painting and
wrote a letter to an artist. Guess who she is.

423
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:44,137
Who? -A girl.

424
00:44:44,403 --> 00:44:45,340
Superb.

425
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:49,603
They’ve been writing to each other
for over a year now. -And then...?

426
00:44:50,443 --> 00:44:55,403
6 months ago, the girl said she likes him.

427
00:44:55,746 --> 00:44:58,442
And that she wants to meet him. -Amazing.

428
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:01,809
Since then he stopped replying to her letters.

429
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:05,208
Is it? -that girl is continuing to write to him.

430
00:45:08,754 --> 00:45:13,378
How can they not meet and write to each other. How?

431
00:45:13,433 --> 00:45:15,739
Ask him only. -Correct.

432
00:45:17,153 --> 00:45:18,803
hey.. hey.. hey.. -Trust me, I’ll take care of it.

433
00:45:18,843 --> 00:45:20,283
-Stop. I beg you.

434
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,692
Damn, I can never keep a secret.

435
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:25,645
I hope you’ll change your mind someday.

436
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:27,763
Srinu, wait outside for 5 minutes.

437
00:45:27,873 --> 00:45:29,989
What? -Wait for 5 minutes.

438
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:33,609
You must turn it off if it’s personal.

439
00:45:33,761 --> 00:45:36,794
Now it’s public.
Your servant has broadcasted the information already.

440
00:45:38,013 --> 00:45:38,973
Hey. -Srinu.

441
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,622
How dare you take the letter. Give it back.
-What’s this, brother?

442
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:45,653
Despite all the chasing she ain’t falling for me.
And you don’t care about the girl who fell for you.

443
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,364
That’s too much, brother. This is against the nature.

444
00:45:48,808 --> 00:45:50,239
Her phone number is here.

445
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,378
My outgoing costs are very reasonable.
-Don’t call her, Srinu. No, don’t call her.

446
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:54,458
Please, Srinu.

447
00:45:55,913 --> 00:45:57,873
Hang up. Srinu, stop it!

448
00:45:58,041 --> 00:45:59,161
Srinu. -Hello.

449
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,170
Her voice is amazing. talk to her. -Hello.

450
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:04,803
No. -Talk!

451
00:46:04,914 --> 00:46:06,567
Talk! -Hello.

452
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,583
Hello.. -Priya.

453
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:14,551
This is Vikram.
I’ve been meaning to call you. But couldn’t.

454
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:16,598
Just a minute. I’ll pass on the phone to Priya.

455
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:20,762
The feeling is amazing. Continue with the flow.

456
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:23,129
Talk to her. What are you doing there? Come here.

457
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:25,145
Hello..

458
00:46:25,714 --> 00:46:26,278
Vikram.

459
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,051
Talk to her, brother.

460
00:46:36,323 --> 00:46:36,801
Priya.

461
00:46:39,744 --> 00:46:40,262
Vikram..

462
00:46:41,457 --> 00:46:43,411
Hey, where is Vikram?

463
00:46:44,283 --> 00:46:45,036
He’s busy.

464
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,067
He was avoiding the phone yesterday.
Today, he isn’t leaving it.

465
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:51,520
Who is it?

466
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:53,919
It’s personal.

467
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:56,911
It’ll take only 5 minutes, Please be seated.

468
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,820
This painting is for me? -Yes.

469
00:47:09,218 --> 00:47:10,684
Yes, from where did you get?

470
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:12,848
From London. -WoW!

471
00:47:13,505 --> 00:47:14,692
How much? - Two Lakhs.

472
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:19,872
How is it?

473
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,231
I don't understand what this artist conveying.

474
00:47:22,978 --> 00:47:25,098
What is this Prasad, I expected you to recognize it.

475
00:47:25,193 --> 00:47:27,193
Yes, I didn't see it properly.

476
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:28,739
Let me see.

477
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:39,340
Yes! I got it.

478
00:47:40,201 --> 00:47:44,129
That Red, Yellow, Blue and Orange.

479
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,606
They are expressing the feelings of a Human.

480
00:47:47,002 --> 00:47:49,403
Prasad, you're a Genius.

481
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:50,544
Thank you.

482
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:53,567
I'll buy it.

483
00:47:54,615 --> 00:47:57,887
You know my taste. -Yes, very well.

484
00:48:02,038 --> 00:48:04,283
Sir, we got the land contact and we checked it and... -
Did you call me, brother?

485
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:06,169
Yes, bring me that cover.

486
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:12,319
What’s all this, brother?

487
00:48:12,817 --> 00:48:14,390
That’s the amount you got for your painting. Two Lakhs.

488
00:48:16,523 --> 00:48:17,866
My painting? -Yes.

489
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:21,600
This is the first time I earned so much money.

490
00:48:23,728 --> 00:48:25,249
This is the first time ever I made money.

491
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:32,265
I used to get weird feelings
when I saw white paper as a child.

492
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,490
To do something. To draw something.
I didn’t understand anything back then.

493
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:38,335
But now I know... No one can stop me now, brother.

494
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:42,449
No one can stop me. I’ll prove myself.
I’ll continue to paint.

495
00:48:56,594 --> 00:48:59,046
It’s been really long I saw you.

496
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:01,780
Well...

497
00:49:02,203 --> 00:49:06,921
(Phone ringing)

498
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:12,554
What’s this?

499
00:49:13,405 --> 00:49:15,554
Srinu asked me to give this to you.

500
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:17,296
What?

501
00:49:17,603 --> 00:49:19,283
Srinu asked me to give you this money.

502
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:29,108
He’ll never change.

503
00:49:39,505 --> 00:49:44,397
Tell him that he’s distanced himself
a little more from the family.

504
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:50,929
I’ve been the breadwinner of this family.
And will continue to be.

505
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:54,030
We don’t need his sympathy. Leave!

506
00:49:56,872 --> 00:50:00,232
I told you, right?
Your mother will never believe you.

507
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,124
What are you doing, dude?
What do you have to do with him?

508
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:12,718
Once again... Brother... I’ll see you in the evening.

509
00:50:13,145 --> 00:50:13,796
You leave now.

510
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:16,569
Hey!

511
00:50:17,737 --> 00:50:18,882
Go away!

512
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:30,841
Sir, you’ve got some mails. -Any letters?

513
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:36,258
Yes, sir. One from TIME magazine,
one from the bank and one is a wedding card.

514
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:38,929
That’s it. Anything else? -That’s all, sir.

515
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:41,858
Okay, leave me alone.

516
00:50:42,633 --> 00:50:43,897
Yes sir. -Srinu.

517
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:45,382
Even you can leave.

518
00:50:49,056 --> 00:50:49,804
Brother..

519
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:53,491
Were you talking about this letter?

520
00:50:55,296 --> 00:50:57,788
But this doesn’t look like a letter. Is it a photograph?

521
00:50:58,015 --> 00:51:00,858
Matters have moved from phone to photo.
-Srinu! Leave the letter here.

522
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,323
Hey, Srinu!
listen to me, Srinu.

523
00:51:03,847 --> 00:51:05,257
Srinu.. No No No!

524
00:51:11,473 --> 00:51:13,811
Brother, you are so done.

525
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,444
There’s something written behind.

526
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:34,015
Coming to Hyderabad on the 11th.
Hope we can catch up.

527
00:51:35,257 --> 00:51:36,390
Hello, subtitles!

528
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,561
Read it in Telugu, I must understand, right?

529
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:43,465
She’s coming to Hyderabad on 11th
and was asking if he could catch up.

530
00:51:43,817 --> 00:51:46,297
We are so catching up. Right, brother?
What do you think, brother?

531
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:50,694
How is it brother?

532
00:51:52,393 --> 00:51:54,944
Even I thought the same, This doesn't suit.

533
00:51:59,418 --> 00:51:59,936
Its not good.

534
00:52:01,608 --> 00:52:02,429
This is too good.

535
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:05,921
Don’t drag the matter any further,
We must take a decision.

536
00:52:06,886 --> 00:52:07,866
Srinu... -What’s it, brother?

537
00:52:08,441 --> 00:52:09,725
You can’t come with me. -Why?

538
00:52:10,432 --> 00:52:11,304
You talk too much.

539
00:52:13,473 --> 00:52:14,163
All right, brother.

540
00:52:15,994 --> 00:52:17,554
But you don’t talk too little.

541
00:52:25,873 --> 00:52:27,022
Kirthi... -Yes sir.

542
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,257
What’s the time?

543
00:52:28,864 --> 00:52:31,744
5.40 -We have 20 minutes more.

544
00:52:37,546 --> 00:52:38,593
Kirthi.. -Sir?

545
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:39,873
What’s the time?

546
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,179
5.50

547
00:52:45,943 --> 00:52:46,671
What’s the time?

548
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,850
5.51, sir..

549
00:52:51,904 --> 00:52:52,507
Let’s go..

550
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:57,710
There’s 5 minutes more, sir.
-I said, let’s go!

551
00:53:18,515 --> 00:53:19,936
What’s it, brother? You didn’t meet her?

552
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:23,835
That’s why you asked me to stay away?
I was right there. Something’s scaring you

553
00:53:25,061 --> 00:53:27,123
You’re scared of writing a letter.
Scared of talking on the phone.

554
00:53:27,272 --> 00:53:29,425
You’re scared of meeting her. What’s the problem?

555
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,054
Srinu.

556
00:53:31,465 --> 00:53:34,296
I don’t need to answer every question of you, Srinu.

557
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:37,007
Be in your limits.

558
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:41,975
Kirthi... -Sir.
let’s go.

559
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:49,003
Kirthi.. -Yes, sir

560
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:53,179
Change my phone number.
Henceforth  I don’t want Priya’s letters to reach me.

561
00:54:02,121 --> 00:54:04,085
You learnt a good lesson yesterday.

562
00:54:04,968 --> 00:54:06,698
Now you know how to behave with him.

563
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,663
Don’t annoy me. -What?

564
00:54:09,753 --> 00:54:12,673
I said it. I’m gonna be in my limits.

565
00:54:12,818 --> 00:54:15,265
That’s exactly why don’t do things he doesn’t like.

566
00:54:15,305 --> 00:54:16,305
Oh...!

567
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,061
He doesn't like?

568
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:21,280
Is that why he gets you to read that girl’s letters?

569
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:27,679
He refused to talk on the phone initially
and then spoke for hours in joy.

570
00:54:28,425 --> 00:54:30,108
That’s exactly why we encouraged him to meet her.

571
00:54:30,657 --> 00:54:32,054
He didn’t meet her and blamed us.

572
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:35,475
These rich guys are beyond my understanding.

573
00:54:37,465 --> 00:54:38,015
Tell me.

574
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:40,921
What?

575
00:54:42,273 --> 00:54:42,733
Did you see?

576
00:54:45,305 --> 00:54:45,921
Where are you?

577
00:54:47,065 --> 00:54:47,530
I'm coming.

578
00:54:49,288 --> 00:54:51,147
What happened? -I’ll see you in an hour.

579
00:54:52,278 --> 00:54:53,069
Please inform him.

580
00:55:02,598 --> 00:55:05,147
You would have missed the ceremony
if you got any late. -Who is he?

581
00:55:05,794 --> 00:55:07,647
Look at the guy behind the guy in brown.
He’s the groom.

582
00:55:19,655 --> 00:55:20,923
Who are you? What are you doing?

583
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:21,757
What are you doing?

584
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:24,376
Who are you? -Take your hand off him.

585
00:55:28,776 --> 00:55:29,944
Who are you?

586
00:55:32,717 --> 00:55:33,968
Who are you to question him?

587
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:36,530
You wanna know who he is. Listen to it from me..

588
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:39,569
He’ll be my husband in 10 minutes.

589
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:41,905
Mother has big dreams about your wedding.

590
00:55:42,186 --> 00:55:43,898
She wont be able to take this.

591
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:45,046
What do you want me to do now?

592
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:47,975
What do I do? We pleaded his father.

593
00:55:48,434 --> 00:55:51,061
They enquired about our family. What do I tell them?

594
00:55:51,545 --> 00:55:56,985
That I have a brother who just got out of the prison?
Or about my rogue younger brother?

595
00:55:58,601 --> 00:56:01,968
Who would accept a girl from such a family.

596
00:56:03,394 --> 00:56:07,850
Will his mother accept me?
Should I ruin my life because of you guys?

597
00:56:10,184 --> 00:56:12,546
Will you go talk his father?

598
00:56:13,073 --> 00:56:14,585
Will you get an approval?

599
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:19,686
Look who’s talking!

600
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:21,874
Sorry!

601
00:56:27,362 --> 00:56:28,163
I will talk!

602
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:34,090
You will talk? What will you talk?

603
00:56:34,513 --> 00:56:36,113
What will you talk?

604
00:56:36,257 --> 00:56:39,617
Swathi, he wants to give it a try.
Let him try.

605
00:56:40,913 --> 00:56:42,866
We’ve waited for so long. We’ll wait for some more time.

606
00:56:51,592 --> 00:56:55,831
Hey, you’re here to talk about your sister.
Be careful.

607
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:56,856
( Dog barking )

608
00:57:01,357 --> 00:57:02,066
Hello, sir.

609
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:06,031
He’s our guy. -My sister...

610
00:57:06,427 --> 00:57:07,355
Swathi..

611
00:57:07,878 --> 00:57:10,448
Your son... -So, you’re the brother.

612
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:11,247
Yes sir.

613
00:57:11,615 --> 00:57:13,895
Was wondering why the dog was barking so much.

614
00:57:15,485 --> 00:57:16,839
You went to the jail I believe.

615
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:19,199
What does your mother do?

616
00:57:21,213 --> 00:57:22,589
Railways... -Ah?

617
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:24,042
She’s a clerk.

618
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:26,683
Oh.. Security! -Sir.

619
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:27,988
Sir.

620
00:57:28,393 --> 00:57:30,073
What’s your salary?
-Rs. 12,000 sir.

621
00:57:30,455 --> 00:57:30,714
Go..

622
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:33,255
What’s your mother’s salary? 7000 or 8000?

623
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:36,824
That was a good move.

624
00:57:37,095 --> 00:57:41,135
To find one from such a family and depend on him.

625
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:43,839
Whose plan was it?

626
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:47,215
Your mother’s or yours?

627
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:53,566
You want to hit me?

628
00:57:55,078 --> 00:57:56,574
You are on parole I heard.

629
00:57:57,926 --> 00:58:01,472
One call and you’ll be back in the prison.

630
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:11,374
Look, My dog also doesn’t like your presence.
How did you expect that I’ll accept your sister.

631
00:58:12,398 --> 00:58:14,558
Go away. -Let’s go.

632
00:58:16,234 --> 00:58:18,730
Sir, I’ve a small suggestion. -What?

633
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:22,241
The board outside reads beware of dog.

634
00:58:22,422 --> 00:58:24,382
Add the ‘S’ let it say beware of dogs.

635
00:58:24,448 --> 00:58:26,888
Hey, sit down.

636
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,699
Your pants are falling off.

637
00:58:38,311 --> 00:58:39,019
Srinu.

638
00:58:40,368 --> 00:58:41,433
Srinu.. -Yes?

639
00:58:42,024 --> 00:58:43,847
What happened? -Nothing, brother.

640
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,597
Srinu, tell me what happened.

641
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:52,284
One must be born rich. Not like us.

642
00:58:52,713 --> 00:58:53,644
We can’t do anything.

643
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,839
Love and relationships is only for the rich.

644
00:58:57,247 --> 00:58:58,378
Not for us.

645
00:59:00,064 --> 00:59:02,933
I stopped my sister’s wedding
because I'm scared for my mother.

646
00:59:04,815 --> 00:59:06,409
I went to talk to him.

647
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,824
I couldn’t stop him
when he said things against my mother.

648
00:59:13,511 --> 00:59:16,902
My mother would be very upset
if my sister married without her knowledge.

649
00:59:21,509 --> 00:59:23,816
Now I know who I am.

650
00:59:38,058 --> 00:59:39,292
Excuse me. -Sir?

651
00:59:39,736 --> 00:59:40,667
I need to meet Mr. Kaalidaas.

652
00:59:40,902 --> 00:59:42,316
I don’t care what you do. -Ok sir.

653
00:59:42,884 --> 00:59:44,636
Sir Prasad Rao..

654
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:48,313
I’d have been there on order.
-I need to talk to you for 5 minutes.

655
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:48,956
Please come.

656
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:52,027
Vikram has a message for you. -Tell me, sir.

657
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:04,253
Now, you must take a call.

658
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:12,408
I need an hour from Mr. Vikramaditya. Please sir.

659
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:35,113
Greetings, sister.

660
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:38,675
May I come in?

661
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,560
My name is Kaalidas. I’m a small time entrepreneur.

662
01:00:51,007 --> 01:00:54,567
I’ll come straight to the point.
My son likes your daughter.

663
01:00:57,823 --> 01:01:00,925
He wanted to marry her but the girl wanted your approval.

664
01:01:04,623 --> 01:01:07,886
Now, I like your girl a lot.
Now that’s called moral upbringing.

665
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:15,370
We can make money any time.
But good character is what a person is born with.

666
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,792
You just give a nod.

667
01:01:17,745 --> 01:01:22,245
I know it is important to consider their wish…
But our status doesn’t match yours…

668
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:25,008
What’s the big deal about status?
Every Tom, Dick and Harry has money these days.

669
01:01:25,112 --> 01:01:28,408
We shouldn’t think about these things.

670
01:01:28,534 --> 01:01:31,673
The girl and boy like each other. That’s all matters.

671
01:01:31,927 --> 01:01:33,863
Your daughter is now our daughter.

672
01:01:35,623 --> 01:01:38,394
Just give your consent.
I will take care of everything else.

673
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:39,659
Is that a ‘yes’ from you?

674
01:01:44,402 --> 01:01:46,853
Okay, sister.  We’ll see you.
Drink some coffee.

675
01:01:46,878 --> 01:01:47,793
Come quickly, Swathi.

676
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:49,953
I have an important meeting to attend in an hour.

677
01:01:50,344 --> 01:01:52,144
This is like my house.
I can join you for coffee at leisure.

678
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:53,925
See you again.

679
01:01:54,408 --> 01:01:55,003
Let's go..

680
01:01:56,101 --> 01:01:57,331
Swathi See them off.

681
01:02:05,343 --> 01:02:06,003
Swathi, my child..

682
01:02:06,854 --> 01:02:08,120
Are you happy now? -Yes.

683
01:02:08,513 --> 01:02:11,495
Can you call your brother
right away and tell him that?

684
01:02:13,874 --> 01:02:14,834
See you.

685
01:02:33,451 --> 01:02:33,897
Hello..

686
01:02:37,191 --> 01:02:38,061
Swathi..

687
01:02:39,982 --> 01:02:41,186
I am sorry, brother.

688
01:02:44,824 --> 01:02:46,819
I never treated you like my brother.

689
01:02:48,902 --> 01:02:51,444
I’ve never given you the respect due to a brother.

690
01:02:53,423 --> 01:02:58,543
I will never forget what you did for me today.

691
01:02:58,895 --> 01:03:02,498
You’ve given me what I wished for.
Thank you, brother.

692
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:36,327
Okay, go!

693
01:03:42,965 --> 01:03:45,713
You should’ve told me before itself that
you’re a close aide of Mr. Vikramaditya.

694
01:03:45,753 --> 01:03:48,153
I am here because of the subcontract
he sanctioned for me.

695
01:03:48,379 --> 01:03:50,408
I spoke a little too much. Please don’t mind.

696
01:03:50,456 --> 01:03:54,616
I spoke to your mother.
Swathi will lead a very happy life. Forget about her.

697
01:03:54,712 --> 01:03:55,324
I’ll see you.

698
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,301
Please don’t take anything to your heart.

699
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:13,574
What’s all this, bro?

700
01:04:15,192 --> 01:04:18,621
If I’m your brother. She’s also my sister.

701
01:04:24,512 --> 01:04:27,465
Just a second. It’s brother calling. What’s up, brother?

702
01:04:27,871 --> 01:04:29,808
Swathi, is mother happy?

703
01:04:29,934 --> 01:04:30,971
Listen to her yourself.

704
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,768
Yes, I'm happy.. Ok sister.

705
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:37,330
Aunt, Swathi’s marriage has been fixed.

706
01:04:38,072 --> 01:04:39,471
They are very rich family.

707
01:04:41,048 --> 01:04:44,041
You said we’d never get a good match for her.
Look what has happened now.

708
01:04:44,872 --> 01:04:48,495
Can I talk to uncle? Pass on the phone.
He’ll get mad that I didn’t tell him.

709
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:52,401
Uncle, your grand-daughter belongs to a rich family now.

710
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,362
She’s very lucky.

711
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,315
I was so worried about her wedding.

712
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,065
By the blessings of almighty, I’m free of that now, uncle.

713
01:05:01,584 --> 01:05:04,221
You guys must come a couple of days before the wedding.

714
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:08,568
Don’t complain later. Alright then, I’ll talk to you later. Bye.

715
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,073
Heard that?

716
01:05:13,153 --> 01:05:13,674
Yes.

717
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:18,463
Please don’t let mother know what happened yesterday.

718
01:05:19,152 --> 01:05:19,932
Okay, brother.

719
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,049
Since my childhood I only saw my mother suffer.

720
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:47,416
For the first time I can sense happiness from her.

721
01:05:50,118 --> 01:05:51,260
It’s all because of you, brother.

722
01:06:10,024 --> 01:06:11,338
Srinu. -Yeah?

723
01:06:11,959 --> 01:06:14,370
Where are you going?
It’s my sister’s wedding.

724
01:06:15,502 --> 01:06:19,080
I want to make money for the arrangements.
I’ll go make a few paintings.

725
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,593
I must hire another Prasad to sell your paintings?

726
01:06:53,863 --> 01:06:54,788
Shut the door.

727
01:06:56,623 --> 01:06:57,491
Shut the door.

728
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:03,199
Lock? -I meant that.

729
01:07:06,262 --> 01:07:07,390
God’s there!

730
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:12,827
you must do something for me.

731
01:07:14,358 --> 01:07:17,585
I am not used to it.

732
01:07:18,678 --> 01:07:20,687
But I’ll try doing whatever you say.

733
01:07:20,968 --> 01:07:23,827
But not now, Later in the evening.

734
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:28,288
I can’t wait until evening. -I can’t wait either.

735
01:07:28,663 --> 01:07:30,030
But we don’t have a choice.

736
01:07:33,205 --> 01:07:35,365
But brother will be there in the evening, right?
-yes, he’ll be there.

737
01:07:35,655 --> 01:07:38,855
He’s the main person, right?
-If he’s main. What am I ?

738
01:07:39,007 --> 01:07:40,767
You’ll be there right next to him, right.

739
01:07:42,718 --> 01:07:45,158
Me and brother together. No way.

740
01:07:45,309 --> 01:07:48,028
But you’ll have to cut his cake, right?

741
01:07:49,222 --> 01:07:52,340
Cake? -Hey, Don’t you know that it’s his birthday today?

742
01:07:53,006 --> 01:07:56,846
Birthday? -We’ve planned a surprise
birthday party at a hotel this evening.

743
01:07:56,991 --> 01:07:59,669
You should bring him there without his knowledge.

744
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:02,005
Please, he must not know.

745
01:08:04,231 --> 01:08:07,713
You wanted to shut the door for this?

746
01:08:07,894 --> 01:08:10,534
Yes, its a surprise. Not one must know.

747
01:08:12,807 --> 01:08:14,575
What were you thinking?

748
01:08:15,632 --> 01:08:16,965
A lot of things.

749
01:08:18,128 --> 01:08:21,648
I thought the surprise was for me.

750
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,360
Leave!

751
01:08:25,815 --> 01:08:27,735
True that.. -Go look into the arrangements.

752
01:08:31,015 --> 01:08:32,295
There’s no Almighty!

753
01:08:39,607 --> 01:08:41,044
Hey, where are you going?

754
01:08:41,806 --> 01:08:43,246
There’s too much traffic. I’ll take a shortcut.

755
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,231
So, there’s a surprise party?

756
01:08:48,037 --> 01:08:51,450
What are you talking about?
She told you everything?

757
01:08:52,022 --> 01:08:53,106
She just can’t keep a secret.

758
01:08:55,351 --> 01:08:59,380
Since 5 years they’ve been thinking
that they surprise me.

759
01:09:00,768 --> 01:09:02,583
And I keep acting like I actually am.

760
01:09:03,465 --> 01:09:05,340
Oh, brother!

761
01:09:06,044 --> 01:09:07,364
What’s the surprise?

762
01:09:08,295 --> 01:09:09,778
You will know. Let’s go.

763
01:09:11,309 --> 01:09:15,288
Happy birthday! Surprise.

764
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:17,184
Prasad! What a surprise.

765
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:22,328
Srinu, even you are surprised, right?
-Beyond words.

766
01:09:22,353 --> 01:09:25,873
You’ve seen nothing. The surprise is still there.
-What’s it, sir?

767
01:09:36,135 --> 01:09:37,575
Amazing! Amazing!

768
01:09:45,356 --> 01:09:46,489
Brother. -Uh?

769
01:09:46,694 --> 01:09:48,551
You’ve been celebrating your birthday like this for 5 years?

770
01:09:50,393 --> 01:09:52,005
Whose idea is this? -It’s my idea.

771
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:53,770
Expected.

772
01:09:55,473 --> 01:09:59,536
What did you expect?
As a human one must have love towards art.

773
01:10:00,048 --> 01:10:02,192
What would you have done? -Sir?

774
01:10:02,473 --> 01:10:03,450
Silence.

775
01:10:04,495 --> 01:10:07,535
It’s okay to silent while praying. But a party?

776
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:22,325
Lakshmi, wake up!

777
01:10:26,648 --> 01:10:29,497
oh, no! -Turn on the lights!

778
01:10:29,566 --> 01:10:33,380
hey, lights on! -hello, there’s no echo!
You go ahead!

779
01:10:33,993 --> 01:10:36,873
one... one... -Who is that?

780
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:38,953
2... 2... 2... -Who are you? Come down, I say!

781
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:45,881
Hey sisters... this guys is being troublesome.
Please spare time with him.

782
01:10:46,073 --> 01:10:47,193
ey ey..!

783
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:50,873
One who’d set the twin cities on fire...

784
01:10:51,028 --> 01:10:54,661
Here’s presenting the dancing peacock! -Steady!

785
01:10:54,738 --> 01:10:58,903
Oops! Not a peacock! -Oh!

786
01:11:00,318 --> 01:11:06,478
Watch all the fun here. Have fun, boy! Music!

787
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:38,513
Do you want to have a drink?

788
01:14:38,647 --> 01:14:41,687
Doctors advised otherwise, Srinu!
-Not again, brother.

789
01:14:42,462 --> 01:14:44,720
Srinu! -Uh?
Thanks!

790
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,283
But why? -You really surprised me.

791
01:14:49,466 --> 01:14:51,150
This is the best birthday I ever had!

792
01:14:51,343 --> 01:14:52,861
Stop it, brother!

793
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:55,736
Srinu! -Ah?

794
01:14:59,102 --> 01:15:00,533
What’s the peacock’s name?

795
01:15:01,353 --> 01:15:02,548
Hahaha.. -Hahaha..

796
01:15:02,752 --> 01:15:05,167
Did anyone hear that? Hahaha..

797
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:22,689
Good night, brother.

798
01:15:24,975 --> 01:15:25,728
Srinu.

799
01:15:27,775 --> 01:15:32,525
You’ll never leave me, right?
-I’ll never go until you ask me to.

800
01:15:34,336 --> 01:15:35,056
Good night.

801
01:16:31,862 --> 01:16:32,908
Good morning, brother!

802
01:16:34,604 --> 01:16:36,368
It’s too late already, wake up!

803
01:16:38,566 --> 01:16:40,704
Brother.. brother...

804
01:16:54,599 --> 01:16:57,959
Brother.. brother...

805
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:02,233
Brother.. brother...

806
01:17:03,673 --> 01:17:05,593
Brother!

807
01:18:34,853 --> 01:18:35,875
It’s nothing but stress.

808
01:18:36,558 --> 01:18:39,648
When we are stressed, we have number of things to do.

809
01:18:40,213 --> 01:18:42,812
we go for a walk or jog...

810
01:18:43,448 --> 01:18:46,218
But it’s very tough for him
considering his physical condition.

811
01:18:47,265 --> 01:18:49,890
His body can’t take it, when he’s stressed.

812
01:18:50,349 --> 01:18:53,804
If this continues, it’s going be very difficult.

813
01:18:55,956 --> 01:18:58,258
It is tough to make him stress-free.

814
01:19:00,075 --> 01:19:03,250
It is a boon if you are able to forget things.
God hasn’t given him that boon.

815
01:19:04,067 --> 01:19:05,742
How is his health now? -He is alright now.

816
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:08,922
We will observe him for a day
and discharge him tomorrow.

817
01:19:11,773 --> 01:19:13,922
Srinu, Drop me home.

818
01:19:21,093 --> 01:19:22,687
That’s a nice house. Is it yours?

819
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,100
No, I stole it from my neighbour. -I thought as much.

820
01:19:27,413 --> 01:19:29,000
You can leave now.

821
01:19:29,756 --> 01:19:30,625
Are you guys Telugu?

822
01:19:31,093 --> 01:19:32,734
I haven’t eaten anything from morning.
This is the first time I am coming home.

823
01:19:33,129 --> 01:19:34,093
Won’t you invite me in and serve me some food?

824
01:19:34,434 --> 01:19:35,461
I guessed right.

825
01:19:36,256 --> 01:19:38,429
You are definitely that villain in the tele-serial.

826
01:19:41,668 --> 01:19:42,039
Ok, come in.

827
01:19:44,937 --> 01:19:45,367
Sit down.

828
01:19:45,778 --> 01:19:48,492
How is Vikram? -He is better.

829
01:19:57,188 --> 01:20:01,108
This painting… -It’s a beautiful painting, right?

830
01:20:01,687 --> 01:20:04,523
Vikram bought it for me. 2 Lakhs.

831
01:20:05,643 --> 01:20:06,961
What is the value you see in this painting?

832
01:20:09,251 --> 01:20:11,811
Do you know anything about painting and art?

833
01:20:13,781 --> 01:20:17,039
To understand art and what the artist tries to convey,
you should not decipher it in your head.

834
01:20:17,425 --> 01:20:19,345
But, feel it in your heart.

835
01:20:20,613 --> 01:20:21,804
So what does this artist convey to you?

836
01:20:23,148 --> 01:20:26,789
Red denotes revolution and anger.

837
01:20:27,954 --> 01:20:31,765
Blue denotes the hope within us.

838
01:20:32,857 --> 01:20:34,726
Can you guess
why the artist has left most of it blank?

839
01:20:36,026 --> 01:20:37,531
Maybe he ran short of paint.

840
01:20:38,727 --> 01:20:40,727
That white space is the happiness within us.

841
01:20:42,745 --> 01:20:45,672
Do you see the specks of orange scattered here and there?

842
01:20:45,893 --> 01:20:47,789
Do you know what that means? -I don’t know.

843
01:20:48,573 --> 01:20:49,133
Love.

844
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:51,226
Friendship

845
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:52,868
Beautiful.

846
01:20:53,071 --> 01:20:54,859
Can’t believe this painting conveys so much.

847
01:20:55,253 --> 01:20:57,406
Must be a great artist…

848
01:20:58,834 --> 01:20:59,656
Thank you.

849
01:21:00,613 --> 01:21:04,293
For what? -For helping me understand its meaning…

850
01:21:04,751 --> 01:21:07,289
It's okay, Beautiful.. Let’s go.

851
01:21:12,646 --> 01:21:13,875
This is imported liquor.

852
01:21:14,259 --> 01:21:16,797
No, I am not. -I don’t believe that.

853
01:21:16,822 --> 01:21:18,250
I am not used to having it with ice cubes.

854
01:21:34,648 --> 01:21:35,242
Sir.

855
01:21:36,405 --> 01:21:38,885
you were talking to the doctor
about brother’s stress or something.

856
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:39,961
What is that, sir?

857
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:43,929
What do you know about Vikram?

858
01:21:44,853 --> 01:21:47,468
He sits where you make him sit.
He eats what you feed.

859
01:21:47,773 --> 01:21:49,533
He sleeps when you make him lie down. That’s all?

860
01:21:50,414 --> 01:21:52,601
He might be confined to a wheelchair now.

861
01:21:53,813 --> 01:21:59,493
But five years back it was different.
We had to zoom on wheels to catch up with him.

862
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:11,410
You know what’s the first thing
I remember by his mention? Speed!

863
01:22:19,805 --> 01:22:23,699
He loves car races and bike races,
Always up for some adventure.

864
01:22:24,133 --> 01:22:30,371
He never knew what failure was. He always won.
Be it in business or a race, he always won.

865
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:32,355
That’s his quality.

866
01:22:33,389 --> 01:22:37,629
However stressed he maybe,
he always had that smile on his face.

867
01:22:43,494 --> 01:22:44,425
Who is this woman, sir?

868
01:22:45,796 --> 01:22:48,356
Nandini his one and only love.

869
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:50,386
He was in madly love with her..

870
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:52,722
They were about to get married.

871
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:55,785
What happened?

872
01:22:57,207 --> 01:23:00,214
He went to Europe for a business trip.
As usual, he was para-gliding....

873
01:23:01,213 --> 01:23:02,386
You know what’s para-gliding, right?

874
01:23:02,863 --> 01:23:06,223
You fly in the sky. That’s his favourite adventure.

875
01:23:06,373 --> 01:23:10,053
He fell off from 150 feet height.

876
01:23:10,656 --> 01:23:11,175
That's it.

877
01:23:12,373 --> 01:23:13,894
Both his cervical got damaged

878
01:23:14,933 --> 01:23:16,893
He went numb from his neck down.

879
01:23:17,383 --> 01:23:17,988
Horrible.

880
01:23:20,293 --> 01:23:24,173
When he regained consciousness,
he wasn’t worried about his condition.

881
01:23:25,038 --> 01:23:25,988
He was anxious about Nandhini.

882
01:23:28,222 --> 01:23:32,693
He felt it would be unfair
to get married to her and be a burden.

883
01:23:34,013 --> 01:23:36,773
He made me lie to her that
he wasn’t interested in getting married to her.

884
01:23:38,492 --> 01:23:41,113
He underwent treatment in Europe for six months.

885
01:23:42,004 --> 01:23:43,714
He never tried meeting her again.

886
01:23:45,058 --> 01:23:48,458
He let go of her thinking that it was the best for her.

887
01:23:48,826 --> 01:23:52,666
He constantly thinks about her well being and happiness.

888
01:23:54,377 --> 01:24:00,894
How much ever he tries to forget his past...
it keeps coming back to him like this.

889
01:24:02,217 --> 01:24:05,004
He was so well. Just can’t see him in this condition.

890
01:24:07,221 --> 01:24:08,707
Nothing must happen to him, sir.

891
01:24:10,235 --> 01:24:12,089
God can never keep anyone happy.

892
01:24:12,669 --> 01:24:13,957
He gets his entertainment from people.

893
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:18,910
He keeps troubling people for fun, sir.

894
01:24:19,916 --> 01:24:20,832
He’s a bad boy!

895
01:24:22,244 --> 01:24:25,707
Now I accept that you’re Telugu.

896
01:24:26,581 --> 01:24:27,918
You are very emotional.

897
01:24:29,129 --> 01:24:34,089
You told me so many facts when I asked.
Despite you not asking, I want to tell you one fact, sir.

898
01:24:35,893 --> 01:24:38,133
I would not be at peace otherwise. -What is that?

899
01:24:39,613 --> 01:24:42,853
I painted that.

900
01:24:47,897 --> 01:24:50,537
I never knew my painting had
so much meaning until you told me.

901
01:24:51,725 --> 01:24:55,589
But thanks for understanding and buying it.
I’ll see you, sir!

902
01:25:10,415 --> 01:25:11,375
Good morning.

903
01:25:12,199 --> 01:25:14,339
Vikram, How are you feeling now?

904
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,280
Much better. -You’ll be discharged today.

905
01:25:17,868 --> 01:25:20,230
There are a couple of medicines
that you have to take for a month.

906
01:25:20,446 --> 01:25:22,406
Who is looking after your medication?

907
01:25:26,687 --> 01:25:27,754
What is this? -Sir.

908
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:30,580
The body might be taking
the medicines but not the heart.

909
01:25:33,243 --> 01:25:34,683
So many medicines for stress?

910
01:25:35,662 --> 01:25:38,622
Some alcohol at night and all
the stress disappears by morning.

911
01:25:39,814 --> 01:25:42,122
You once told me that you
go to some place when you are stressed.

912
01:25:42,599 --> 01:25:43,153
Which place is that?

913
01:25:43,864 --> 01:25:44,664
Paris.

914
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:46,317
Paris.

915
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:47,754
Can we go to Paris?

916
01:25:48,568 --> 01:25:49,325
Have you gone crazy?

917
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,481
How can he go when he is in this condition?

918
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,184
Paris, Are you planning the trip for him
or for yourself?

919
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:55,356
I don’t care what you think.

920
01:25:56,443 --> 01:26:00,843
You would have been to Paris many times.
But this is my only chance. Can I tag along with you?

921
01:26:02,853 --> 01:26:06,981
Ok, I’ve missed seeing a lot of things in my life.
I will add one more to my list now.

922
01:26:07,006 --> 01:26:10,526
That’s enough of over-acting!
We can’t take it.

923
01:26:11,221 --> 01:26:11,762
Prasad.

924
01:26:14,831 --> 01:26:17,700
Didn’t you tell me that Srinu is on parole?

925
01:26:18,566 --> 01:26:22,184
Take care of those formalities. We are going to Paris.

926
01:26:50,541 --> 01:26:51,778
How much does a ticket to Paris cost?

927
01:26:52,743 --> 01:26:53,926
This is our plane.

928
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,208
You make it sound so normal.

929
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,480
Such a beautiful city, Srinu.

930
01:28:20,773 --> 01:28:23,230
I agree. Very beautiful!

931
01:28:23,503 --> 01:28:26,035
Paris, City of love.

932
01:28:28,384 --> 01:28:29,269
Full of love…

933
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:32,782
Good morning sir. -Good morning.

934
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:33,973
Why are you so beautiful?

935
01:28:34,278 --> 01:28:34,816
What?

936
01:28:35,086 --> 01:28:38,230
Brother was mentioning that Paris is beautiful. Right?

937
01:28:38,485 --> 01:28:39,365
Yes.

938
01:28:41,246 --> 01:28:41,926
Sir..

939
01:28:42,056 --> 01:28:44,696
I sat up all night and made the best plan to see Paris.

940
01:28:44,973 --> 01:28:47,808
Ten o’clock is the best town to see. -Eifel Tower!

941
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:51,137
After that we can go to... -Louvre Museum...

942
01:28:51,697 --> 01:28:53,183
And then we go to the music street.

943
01:28:53,685 --> 01:28:56,019
And finally to the romantic river cruise.

944
01:28:56,089 --> 01:28:56,929
Brother.

945
01:28:58,175 --> 01:28:59,535
Have you worked as a guide here?

946
01:29:01,504 --> 01:29:02,863
I love Paris, Srinu.

947
01:29:07,799 --> 01:29:10,113
They’ve built such a huge cell phone tower.

948
01:29:11,022 --> 01:29:12,340
I don’t think they will ever have network issues.

949
01:29:12,521 --> 01:29:14,961
That is not a cell phone tower.
That’s Eiffel Tower.

950
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,000
Oh! They give a name even for cell phone towers.

951
01:29:20,622 --> 01:29:22,863
It's so beautiful sir.. - It is..

952
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:24,159
Click a picture.

953
01:29:49,053 --> 01:29:50,395
Idiot. What are you doing?

954
01:29:50,591 --> 01:29:54,473
Don’t you want the tower in the background?
Just focus on me. That will do.

955
01:29:54,589 --> 01:29:56,801
If you wanted a picture of only yourself,
you’ve could have got one back home.

956
01:29:57,778 --> 01:29:58,942
What do you say, brother?

957
01:29:59,206 --> 01:30:02,166
Only if the tower’s in the picture will
she get lots of likes on facebook, right?

958
01:30:02,495 --> 01:30:02,989
That’s true.

959
01:30:03,307 --> 01:30:04,301
Some people will never understand.

960
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:48,715
Srinu, let’s go!

961
01:30:58,407 --> 01:31:00,007
One painting costs 50 Lakhs?

962
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,251
You might not get one for even 50 Crores.

963
01:31:04,265 --> 01:31:06,008
I must start painting here.

964
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:09,704
Srinu, let’s go!

965
01:31:12,469 --> 01:31:14,962
This is amazing. Let’s take a picture here.

966
01:31:15,296 --> 01:31:16,579
Give it to me. -Hey, that’s my phone.

967
01:31:18,135 --> 01:31:18,938
Brother, smile please.

968
01:31:19,985 --> 01:31:20,422
Brother.

969
01:31:35,493 --> 01:31:36,610
Kirthi... -Yes sir.

970
01:31:37,293 --> 01:31:38,821
We are leaving tomorrow. -What, brother?

971
01:31:41,261 --> 01:31:42,438
We are going back to India tomorrow.

972
01:31:42,813 --> 01:31:43,594
What happened, brother?

973
01:31:44,373 --> 01:31:48,376
You love Paris..
And now you want to go back?

974
01:31:51,223 --> 01:31:52,579
I don’t like myself, Srinu.

975
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:56,587
For the first time I am missing myself.

976
01:31:59,685 --> 01:32:02,219
When you said Paris, I was very excited.

977
01:32:03,278 --> 01:32:04,696
I thought I’ll find myself.

978
01:32:08,348 --> 01:32:09,805
But I just realised...

979
01:32:12,695 --> 01:32:13,977
That Vikram is no more.

980
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:16,040
I can never find him again.

981
01:32:18,302 --> 01:32:19,735
But one thing is true.

982
01:32:21,406 --> 01:32:24,766
I realise that the heart doesn’t follow you
wherever you go.

983
01:32:53,124 --> 01:32:54,724
Idiot! Stop the car.

984
01:32:58,163 --> 01:32:59,899
Srinu, Don’t let them go.

985
01:33:04,132 --> 01:33:05,313
Overtake that car.

986
01:33:39,219 --> 01:33:40,422
Change the gear.

987
01:33:53,803 --> 01:33:54,860
You want to play with us?

988
01:33:55,743 --> 01:34:00,938
Lets, go. -Press the brake and then accelerate.

989
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,946
Kirthi, wear your seat belt.

990
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:54,813
Srinu, Right.

991
01:36:08,191 --> 01:36:09,055
Go, srinu.

992
01:37:05,091 --> 01:37:07,122
Shift the gear and accelerate.

993
01:38:11,923 --> 01:38:14,323
Srinu, let’s go see Paris now.

994
01:40:12,856 --> 01:40:13,545
Wow!

995
01:40:43,644 --> 01:40:47,427
5 years ago... I met with an accident right here.

996
01:40:51,513 --> 01:40:55,192
In just a second my life became a memory.

997
01:40:58,451 --> 01:41:00,291
Why remember all that now, brother. Let’s go!

998
01:41:04,226 --> 01:41:05,794
Srinu.. -Brother.

999
01:41:06,258 --> 01:41:07,145
I want to fly!

1000
01:41:08,705 --> 01:41:09,333
What?

1001
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:12,778
I want to fly!

1002
01:41:15,753 --> 01:41:17,481
Don't worry, I am doing good.

1003
01:41:18,642 --> 01:41:20,442
This is madness. What are you doing..?

1004
01:41:20,623 --> 01:41:23,763
You should have denied, right?
-Let him do whatever he wants to do.

1005
01:41:25,899 --> 01:41:26,630
What is it?

1006
01:41:28,243 --> 01:41:31,043
No No.. Hey, leave me!

1007
01:41:31,375 --> 01:41:34,145
no no .. brother!

1008
01:41:34,364 --> 01:41:36,028
Even though your limbs don’t function..
everyone is looking at you.

1009
01:41:36,187 --> 01:41:38,309
I am perfectly alright. No one is looking at me.
No, brother. No!

1010
01:41:39,114 --> 01:41:41,520
You can tell him, right? Go, tell him!

1011
01:41:42,244 --> 01:41:44,419
Let him do whatever he wants to do.

1012
01:41:46,204 --> 01:41:49,138
That’s how you’re giving back to me? Tell him!

1013
01:42:08,514 --> 01:42:11,388
Hey.. No.. I'm a virgin, there is a lot see..

1014
01:42:21,643 --> 01:42:25,083
Hey.. I'll get heart attack please leave me.

1015
01:42:35,105 --> 01:42:36,372
Looks like he’s having fun!

1016
01:42:47,019 --> 01:42:49,153
What’s that sound? What’s with the fear?

1017
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:52,270
Don’t laugh loud, brother. Kirthi can hear you.

1018
01:42:52,872 --> 01:42:56,567
I was very strong until now. It’s all over now, brother.

1019
01:42:56,795 --> 01:43:00,355
You were trying to impress her for three months.
Did she ever look at you?

1020
01:43:00,643 --> 01:43:03,683
No, brother. I never took it seriously.

1021
01:43:03,773 --> 01:43:05,498
Are you scared of taking it seriously?

1022
01:43:05,538 --> 01:43:06,978
Scared about what? -Then, go tell her.

1023
01:43:07,356 --> 01:43:08,396
I will...

1024
01:43:09,963 --> 01:43:10,991
I’ll propose to her with a flower.

1025
01:43:24,565 --> 01:43:25,624
Ki.. Kirthi..

1026
01:43:27,028 --> 01:43:27,569
What?

1027
01:43:28,923 --> 01:43:30,530
What’s with the flower?

1028
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:35,780
The flower dried up. Thought I’ll change.

1029
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:40,272
Are you working?

1030
01:43:41,194 --> 01:43:43,366
Nope. I’m sleeping. -Okay, sleep well.

1031
01:43:49,784 --> 01:43:52,984
I was so confident when I went.

1032
01:43:53,803 --> 01:43:57,483
But my heart started beating
so fast when I went closer.

1033
01:43:57,611 --> 01:43:59,531
That’s called fear, Srinu.

1034
01:44:00,266 --> 01:44:02,202
Where there’s love, there’s fear.

1035
01:44:03,723 --> 01:44:06,835
Fear of rejection.

1036
01:44:08,419 --> 01:44:11,014
Fear of loss after acceptance.

1037
01:44:13,205 --> 01:44:17,967
Fear of moving apart.

1038
01:44:21,538 --> 01:44:23,569
Truly, where there’s fear, there’s love.

1039
01:44:24,947 --> 01:44:28,592
Your thought is so profound.

1040
01:44:29,923 --> 01:44:31,670
Once upon a time you were a romantic, right?

1041
01:44:32,274 --> 01:44:33,592
Even now!

1042
01:44:36,481 --> 01:44:40,436
Even now? You’re drunk. Let’s go!

1043
01:44:41,683 --> 01:44:43,639
You won't believe me? -Nope.

1044
01:44:44,843 --> 01:44:45,702
Try me!

1045
01:44:47,923 --> 01:44:51,763
Pick up a girl. I’ll make her fall for me in two days.

1046
01:44:52,730 --> 01:44:53,749
Pick one.

1047
01:45:10,483 --> 01:45:11,327
What’s the bet?

1048
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:16,145
What if she falls for me in two days? What’s the bet?

1049
01:45:17,506 --> 01:45:18,497
You decide!

1050
01:45:18,725 --> 01:45:22,445
If she falls for me in two days..
you must disclose your feelings to kirthi.

1051
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:26,740
If she falls for you. Done. Let’s see.

1052
01:46:14,552 --> 01:46:16,888
Brother! he’s here.
Where do I send him again?

1053
01:46:18,112 --> 01:46:20,223
Give him some money and ask him to leave.

1054
01:46:23,001 --> 01:46:27,950
Thanks for the bike, brother. We are now done.
How do I tell that in his language?

1055
01:46:30,683 --> 01:46:33,566
Je t’aime.  Serre moi. Embrazze moi!

1056
01:46:37,185 --> 01:46:40,636
You think I cant say it?
I will do it, wait and see.

1057
01:46:42,150 --> 01:46:45,378
He’ll just say it. -Let him.

1058
01:46:45,768 --> 01:46:48,933
Je t’aime.  Serre moi. Embrazze moi!

1059
01:46:54,933 --> 01:46:56,238
Why are you holding my hand?

1060
01:46:57,349 --> 01:46:59,941
Your work is done. Leave.
Why are you falling on me?

1061
01:47:01,628 --> 01:47:03,699
I’m not that kind of a guy.

1062
01:47:06,406 --> 01:47:07,387
Don't allow him.

1063
01:47:11,271 --> 01:47:13,754
Why is he falling on me
when I asked him to leave?

1064
01:47:14,833 --> 01:47:18,527
You said.. you loved him and asked him to hug and kiss.

1065
01:47:18,826 --> 01:47:19,699
Me?

1066
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,037
What’s this, brother?

1067
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,270
Go away!

1068
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,309
Will she come, brother?

1069
01:47:39,057 --> 01:47:40,145
For sure..

1070
01:47:41,074 --> 01:47:43,629
Will girls come on sending that flower?
You are too much!

1071
01:47:43,973 --> 01:47:45,603
I didn’t send her flowers.

1072
01:47:45,713 --> 01:47:47,473
Curiosity. - what?

1073
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:50,200
Curiosity.

1074
01:47:51,626 --> 01:47:52,574
I don’t believe it.

1075
01:48:00,862 --> 01:48:01,824
She’s here.

1076
01:48:03,209 --> 01:48:05,652
Curiosity is here. -Why are you still here? Leave!

1077
01:48:13,004 --> 01:48:15,395
You knew she was coming?
You are waiting at the right place.

1078
01:48:19,603 --> 01:48:20,113
Jenny.

1079
01:48:21,776 --> 01:48:22,707
You're looking for me?

1080
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:25,356
Vikram! -Ya it's me.

1081
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:36,500
Is it you who sent me the flowers? -Yeah.

1082
01:48:36,873 --> 01:48:37,713
But why?

1083
01:48:37,963 --> 01:48:40,283
Beauty not admired is a sin.

1084
01:48:41,545 --> 01:48:42,395
You’re beautiful.

1085
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,231
Hello, subtitles!

1086
01:48:45,643 --> 01:48:46,270
What?

1087
01:48:46,906 --> 01:48:49,442
What’s the girl saying?
-She asked why he sent the flowers?

1088
01:48:49,888 --> 01:48:52,708
What did brother say?
-Beauty not admired is a sin.

1089
01:48:53,272 --> 01:48:54,520
You’re beautiful.

1090
01:48:55,226 --> 01:48:56,817
This is exactly what I wanted to say.

1091
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:00,043
Why did you send me flowers?

1092
01:49:00,201 --> 01:49:01,895
I want to go out on a date with you.

1093
01:49:02,344 --> 01:49:03,629
A date? -Yeah.

1094
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:07,754
With you? -Don’t go by the looks.

1095
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:09,669
Looks can be deceiving.

1096
01:49:10,064 --> 01:49:12,944
What if I say no? -Think before you say no.

1097
01:49:13,569 --> 01:49:16,286
You just might miss
one of the most beautiful day in your life.

1098
01:49:20,934 --> 01:49:23,575
It’s amazing. You know what he said...

1099
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:26,559
The girl laughed. She’s fallen for him.
The game is over!

1100
01:49:57,168 --> 01:49:58,497
Hello.. Hello..

1101
01:49:58,708 --> 01:50:00,614
Why do you want to disturb them. Let’s go.

1102
01:50:00,808 --> 01:50:03,128
Why should I interrupt the two of you.

1103
01:50:03,738 --> 01:50:04,676
Two of us?

1104
01:50:12,616 --> 01:50:13,911
I can’t take it anymore.

1105
01:50:20,586 --> 01:50:22,278
Where were you hiding all these days, Jenny?

1106
01:50:23,962 --> 01:50:25,934
Never seen Sir so happy before.

1107
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:30,190
How did you figure out that coming here
would make him so happy?

1108
01:50:31,949 --> 01:50:34,269
I didn’t know. My mother always said...

1109
01:50:34,493 --> 01:50:36,465
You’ll find where you lost.

1110
01:50:37,965 --> 01:50:40,365
He lost it all here. That’s why I got him here.

1111
01:50:47,176 --> 01:50:49,047
Is there a show happening here? -Ya.

1112
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:50,711
It's your show.

1113
01:50:52,092 --> 01:50:53,414
My show? -Yes.

1114
01:50:54,262 --> 01:50:56,515
Perfect day is not over without a dance.

1115
01:50:58,005 --> 01:50:59,070
Will you dance with me?

1116
01:51:00,949 --> 01:51:01,883
Dance with you?

1117
01:51:03,551 --> 01:51:06,156
How is that possible? -Just dance with me.

1118
01:51:07,121 --> 01:51:10,164
Every breath and move you make, I'll be there with you.

1119
01:51:11,649 --> 01:51:13,414
Yes, It's a promise.

1120
01:53:04,215 --> 01:53:05,265
That was magical.

1121
01:53:06,494 --> 01:53:09,859
You're right,
It was one of the most beautiful days of my life.

1122
01:53:12,337 --> 01:53:12,897
Thank you.

1123
01:53:46,291 --> 01:53:47,148
Hmm..

1124
01:53:47,818 --> 01:53:51,378
You are like this today.
How were you before the incident?

1125
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:55,600
How can any girl come like that?
How can she laugh like that?

1126
01:53:55,690 --> 01:53:59,130
How could she dance? The kisses... oh my!

1127
01:53:59,594 --> 01:54:02,354
You think I’ll forget the bet if you divert me?

1128
01:54:03,723 --> 01:54:05,054
What bet are you talking about?

1129
01:54:05,386 --> 01:54:06,875
You must go and talk to Kirthi.

1130
01:54:07,258 --> 01:54:08,687
It’s late. Sleep now. Good night!

1131
01:54:09,018 --> 01:54:10,178
You are not standing by your words.

1132
01:54:12,039 --> 01:54:13,523
I can’t talk like you, brother.

1133
01:54:13,666 --> 01:54:15,986
You must have thought about it
before accepting the challenge.

1134
01:54:17,203 --> 01:54:17,906
Srinu..

1135
01:54:18,715 --> 01:54:20,578
Just say whatever you have in your heart.

1136
01:54:22,243 --> 01:54:22,812
Go.

1137
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:25,711
I’m going only because of you.

1138
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:28,703
Srinu..

1139
01:54:30,059 --> 01:54:31,742
You are forgetting the flower.

1140
01:54:45,301 --> 01:54:45,859
Kirthi..

1141
01:54:47,008 --> 01:54:48,211
I need to talk to you...

1142
01:54:49,362 --> 01:54:50,578
Don’t turn around.

1143
01:54:51,083 --> 01:54:52,570
I might not be able to talk then.

1144
01:54:56,108 --> 01:54:57,172
I’ll tell you a truth.

1145
01:54:58,352 --> 01:55:00,070
I’m really scared of you.

1146
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:06,220
Because I can’t match up to you...

1147
01:55:06,864 --> 01:55:08,984
Don’t think about our compatibility.

1148
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:13,023
Meenakshi and I complemented each other,
but that didn’t work out.. right?

1149
01:55:13,483 --> 01:55:16,461
That means we can work out.

1150
01:55:17,411 --> 01:55:22,304
But Meenakshi is not as great as you. You are hot!

1151
01:55:26,482 --> 01:55:26,968
See..

1152
01:55:28,123 --> 01:55:30,140
I feared talking like this.

1153
01:55:31,604 --> 01:55:35,531
But brother said where there’s fear, there’s love.

1154
01:55:38,731 --> 01:55:39,648
I am saying it...

1155
01:55:40,668 --> 01:55:41,523
I am saying it...

1156
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:45,054
I

1157
01:55:47,629 --> 01:55:48,250
Love

1158
01:55:50,188 --> 01:55:50,515
You.

1159
01:55:58,355 --> 01:55:58,961
Hey!

1160
01:56:00,177 --> 01:56:01,351
you didn’t scold me.

1161
01:56:02,708 --> 01:56:03,734
Is that a yes?

1162
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:23,154
Srinu..

1163
01:56:33,307 --> 01:56:35,591
Are you blind?

1164
01:56:36,276 --> 01:56:38,356
Just because there is a girl in front of you,
will you not see the glass?

1165
01:56:38,894 --> 01:56:41,334
What an embarrassment?
How will you go back to India?

1166
01:56:51,483 --> 01:56:52,865
He is a pain.

1167
01:56:54,951 --> 01:56:55,755
Hey, Where are you?

1168
01:56:56,012 --> 01:56:57,068
Come out..

1169
01:56:57,617 --> 01:56:59,310
I’ve come to visit your country
and you give me flowers.

1170
01:57:00,756 --> 01:57:02,122
Flowers! who sent?
where is he?

1171
01:57:03,303 --> 01:57:06,654
Excuse me..  I am sorry.
I am sorry. You can go!

1172
01:57:08,213 --> 01:57:09,013
Why are you screaming?

1173
01:57:09,163 --> 01:57:11,201
Despite warning him, he sent me flowers.

1174
01:57:12,967 --> 01:57:14,567
Are you sure he sent you the flowers? -Then?

1175
01:57:14,907 --> 01:57:16,427
Who else will send flowers to me?

1176
01:57:16,583 --> 01:57:17,888
look at the flowers closely.

1177
01:57:30,287 --> 01:57:31,732
I wanted to give you the flower..

1178
01:57:35,212 --> 01:57:38,029
Then who kept the flowers? -I kept it there.

1179
01:57:39,462 --> 01:57:40,224
Does that mean you heard me?

1180
01:57:41,342 --> 01:57:42,029
Don’t ask me

1181
01:57:43,166 --> 01:57:46,130
I don’t know how I liked you.

1182
01:57:47,231 --> 01:57:51,724
But I know the one you love will remain happy forever.

1183
01:57:52,751 --> 01:57:54,388
I can see that in sir.

1184
01:57:55,858 --> 01:57:58,482
I need that. That’s why I like you.

1185
01:58:03,453 --> 01:58:04,044
Hey, wait!

1186
01:58:05,412 --> 01:58:09,044
Are you informing me or confirming it to me?

1187
01:58:13,483 --> 01:58:15,654
Hey. That smile!

1188
02:01:49,691 --> 02:01:51,074
Brother.. I'll be right back..

1189
02:01:57,517 --> 02:01:58,621
Brother! -Yeah?

1190
02:02:12,875 --> 02:02:13,379
Srinu!

1191
02:02:17,891 --> 02:02:18,394
Srinu!

1192
02:02:20,488 --> 02:02:21,098
Srinu come..

1193
02:02:41,716 --> 02:02:42,621
Srinu.

1194
02:03:01,610 --> 02:03:02,191
Vikram.

1195
02:03:11,811 --> 02:03:13,324
Are you running away from me?

1196
02:04:36,603 --> 02:04:40,203
When you left me, I didn’t suspect anything.

1197
02:04:41,186 --> 02:04:42,826
I believed we were in love.

1198
02:04:43,602 --> 02:04:45,882
That moment you went away is still fresh in mind.

1199
02:04:47,922 --> 02:04:53,442
I thought I should never see you
or think of you again.

1200
02:04:54,999 --> 02:04:56,582
But when I continued thinking of you..

1201
02:04:57,451 --> 02:05:01,590
I was angry with myself for falling in love
with a man like you.

1202
02:05:02,074 --> 02:05:05,098
I began to hate you. But a week back..

1203
02:05:07,770 --> 02:05:10,019
Srinu called me to tell me everything.

1204
02:05:24,043 --> 02:05:29,371
I wondered how I stayed happy despite
of having so much hatred in me

1205
02:05:32,357 --> 02:05:34,035
It was only after I spoke to Srinu

1206
02:05:35,993 --> 02:05:42,996
Your good wishes for me were way stronger
than my hatred towards you.

1207
02:05:44,978 --> 02:05:48,543
How, Vikram? How can you love someone so much?

1208
02:05:49,697 --> 02:05:53,257
These five years, You lost yourself for me.

1209
02:05:54,673 --> 02:05:56,848
You were worried about me, right?

1210
02:05:59,323 --> 02:06:02,582
You kept away from me because
you wanted us to be happy, right?

1211
02:06:04,713 --> 02:06:06,878
And you are leaving without seeing that happiness?

1212
02:06:23,410 --> 02:06:24,648
That’s my daughter Aadhya

1213
02:06:26,891 --> 02:06:28,242
And my husband Abhinav.

1214
02:06:32,247 --> 02:06:35,156
This is my family. My happiness.

1215
02:07:59,007 --> 02:08:01,124
Thanks, Vikram. Thanks for meeting me.

1216
02:08:01,629 --> 02:08:04,937
I’d have hated you for life hadn’t you met me.

1217
02:08:05,583 --> 02:08:10,863
You hope to love me and not have me.

1218
02:08:11,366 --> 02:08:18,656
As much as you want me to be happy,
I want you to be happier than that.

1219
02:08:19,069 --> 02:08:20,601
Hope you make my wish come true.

1220
02:08:42,036 --> 02:08:45,854
How are you? I have a scent bottle for you.
-Hi, vikram.

1221
02:08:46,383 --> 02:08:48,623
How are you, old man?
-Who is the old man?

1222
02:08:49,758 --> 02:08:51,815
I saw an excellent painting for you in Paris.

1223
02:08:54,349 --> 02:08:57,065
Of all the things you found
a painting for me in Paris?

1224
02:08:58,983 --> 02:09:00,183
Lakshmi. -Sir?

1225
02:09:00,396 --> 02:09:02,940
I’m tired of all the salads I had in the last 10 days.

1226
02:09:03,805 --> 02:09:05,565
Make me some yummy stew.

1227
02:09:08,869 --> 02:09:11,149
Just a second, sir.
Give me that plate...

1228
02:09:11,318 --> 02:09:14,487
Where did I keep the plate?
Not this one, give me a bowl for stew.

1229
02:09:14,605 --> 02:09:16,525
You washed it properly, right?

1230
02:09:16,992 --> 02:09:19,552
Give me some pepper and some coriander powder..
-Lakshmi.

1231
02:09:20,246 --> 02:09:21,440
Why are you in such a hurry?

1232
02:09:21,557 --> 02:09:25,237
It’s been 5 years.
He asked me something for the first time.

1233
02:09:25,423 --> 02:09:27,663
I don’t have time for this. I need to serve him stew.

1234
02:09:27,663 --> 02:09:29,323
Get me some tamarind.

1235
02:09:31,839 --> 02:09:34,807
Looks like you had a great holiday. -I met Nandini.

1236
02:09:53,806 --> 02:09:54,753
Srinu.

1237
02:09:57,750 --> 02:09:58,972
Hi Sir, how have you been?

1238
02:09:59,423 --> 02:10:03,303
I asked him that day...
why did you choose him?

1239
02:10:04,712 --> 02:10:08,072
He said,
you were the right choice that moment.

1240
02:10:09,109 --> 02:10:10,745
I felt he was doing wrong.

1241
02:10:12,581 --> 02:10:13,589
But it’s my mistake.

1242
02:10:14,853 --> 02:10:18,253
I  saw him in this condition for
5 years and did nothing.

1243
02:10:19,023 --> 02:10:21,023
I told you about him for 5 minutes...

1244
02:10:22,004 --> 02:10:23,479
And you changed his life.

1245
02:10:25,325 --> 02:10:25,831
Thank you.

1246
02:10:27,503 --> 02:10:28,863
You’d never leave him, right?

1247
02:10:29,103 --> 02:10:32,097
Why would I leave a bathroom
and bedroom like this, sir.

1248
02:10:33,165 --> 02:10:34,620
Where would I go anyway.

1249
02:10:36,868 --> 02:10:38,604
I have a small doubt. -What’s that, sir?

1250
02:10:40,318 --> 02:10:41,073
Painting..

1251
02:10:42,896 --> 02:10:44,856
Did you really paint that? -You’re too much.

1252
02:10:44,999 --> 02:10:48,039
I trusted you and started another painting as well.
-Spare me, dude!

1253
02:10:48,387 --> 02:10:50,467
Sir! -Thank you very much.

1254
02:10:52,807 --> 02:10:55,682
Prasad knew that you painted that?
I told him, brother.

1255
02:10:55,707 --> 02:10:57,987
Srinu, Someone is here for you.

1256
02:10:58,454 --> 02:10:59,261
For me?

1257
02:11:21,817 --> 02:11:24,329
Who told you that I was here?

1258
02:11:25,621 --> 02:11:26,454
Sister told me.

1259
02:11:34,399 --> 02:11:38,923
Hey open your mouth, where’s your son?

1260
02:11:40,470 --> 02:11:43,350
He has been booked under attempt to murder case.

1261
02:11:50,376 --> 02:11:53,399
Your son got drunk with his friends
and got into a fight at the bar.

1262
02:11:53,705 --> 02:11:56,465
Two of them are in the hospital.
They are fighting for their life.

1263
02:11:56,854 --> 02:11:58,814
We know that you know where he is.

1264
02:11:59,228 --> 02:12:00,915
He better surrender himself by morning.

1265
02:12:01,274 --> 02:12:04,118
But if we find him, you know what’s gonna happen.

1266
02:12:08,892 --> 02:12:09,610
What did you do?

1267
02:12:11,285 --> 02:12:12,188
Tell me what happened?

1268
02:12:12,934 --> 02:12:14,469
I didn’t do anything.

1269
02:12:15,445 --> 02:12:16,579
They were having a fight.

1270
02:12:17,231 --> 02:12:20,271
I was just there. I didn’t hit anyone.

1271
02:12:25,969 --> 02:12:27,384
Okay, sit here.

1272
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:40,462
Just a minute, brother.

1273
02:12:42,610 --> 02:12:43,860
Swathi? – Brother..

1274
02:12:43,996 --> 02:12:45,626
He’s with me. I’ll look after this.

1275
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:47,891
You take care of mother.

1276
02:12:50,769 --> 02:12:53,696
This is exactly what I was worried the most about.

1277
02:12:55,302 --> 02:12:58,407
I lost one son already.. and now the other.

1278
02:12:59,784 --> 02:13:01,501
What have I done? -Mother.

1279
02:13:09,149 --> 02:13:10,571
Srinu! -What is it about?

1280
02:13:10,841 --> 02:13:12,805
You remembered us after a long time.

1281
02:13:13,664 --> 02:13:16,744
Kanna is in some problem. Take him to your village

1282
02:13:17,789 --> 02:13:20,813
He better not be seen in the city for at least 2 weeks.
-you’re coming, right?

1283
02:13:20,984 --> 02:13:22,594
You know I can’t go.

1284
02:13:23,941 --> 02:13:25,868
You come quickly. -Okay. Hey, bring the vehicle!

1285
02:13:29,352 --> 02:13:31,368
Do you want to sleep, brother?
-What happened, srinu?

1286
02:13:31,447 --> 02:13:33,527
Nothing much, brother. Just a small issue.
-Is he your brother?

1287
02:13:35,714 --> 02:13:37,794
Why bother about all that now?
Let’s hit the bed.

1288
02:13:38,551 --> 02:13:41,591
When you called me brother,
I thought you meant it.

1289
02:13:42,886 --> 02:13:47,063
But you hide a lot of things from me.
I don’t know.

1290
02:13:48,214 --> 02:13:48,837
Ok.

1291
02:13:54,226 --> 02:13:55,157
He is not my brother.

1292
02:13:58,279 --> 02:13:59,579
He is not my own brother.

1293
02:14:06,559 --> 02:14:10,360
Even the person I call my mother
is not the one who gave birth to me.

1294
02:14:20,568 --> 02:14:23,540
She is my mother’s sister.

1295
02:14:24,993 --> 02:14:27,953
When I was seven years old,
my parents died in an accident.

1296
02:14:29,385 --> 02:14:35,305
When everyone wanted to send me to an orphanage,
my aunt said she would raise me.

1297
02:14:36,513 --> 02:14:38,430
My sister and brother were born later.

1298
02:14:39,446 --> 02:14:44,079
After my uncle died,
my mother had a tough time raising all of us.

1299
02:14:44,642 --> 02:14:49,162
When I saw her struggling,
I would think I was an added burden to her.

1300
02:14:50,616 --> 02:14:51,790
I thought I would ease her troubles
by not going to school.

1301
02:14:52,328 --> 02:14:54,641
When she questioned me I didn’t say anything.

1302
02:14:55,896 --> 02:14:58,856
Ever since, we quarrelled a lot.

1303
02:14:59,243 --> 02:15:01,032
I wanted to do a lot for her...

1304
02:15:01,501 --> 02:15:04,071
I wanted to earn a lot of money to give her.

1305
02:15:04,837 --> 02:15:06,571
But I didn’t know how to earn it.

1306
02:15:07,693 --> 02:15:10,413
That’s why I started stealing.

1307
02:15:10,985 --> 02:15:11,969
She said me to get out of the house

1308
02:15:12,188 --> 02:15:17,446
I want to make money for her happiness
and not for myself.

1309
02:15:19,063 --> 02:15:20,774
But she never understood me.

1310
02:15:22,621 --> 02:15:24,399
She’s blaming me even now.

1311
02:15:29,799 --> 02:15:35,439
If money brings happiness,
I should be the happiest man in this universe, Srinu.

1312
02:15:37,905 --> 02:15:43,352
I needed a man who was just out of jail
to show me what happiness was.

1313
02:15:45,504 --> 02:15:48,774
Do you know where your happiness lies?

1314
02:15:50,181 --> 02:15:50,985
It’s with your mother.

1315
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:56,212
You want to be close to your mother,
but you are distancing yourself from her.

1316
02:15:58,255 --> 02:15:58,915
Go away, srinu.

1317
02:16:03,153 --> 02:16:05,563
You can’t live alongside a wheelchair all your life, right?

1318
02:16:07,438 --> 02:16:10,985
Your mother needs you more than me.

1319
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:17,485
You gave so much to a complete stranger like me...
imagine what you can do for your mother.

1320
02:16:19,072 --> 02:16:23,610
You must find where you lost, srinu.

1321
02:16:41,016 --> 02:16:43,524
I’ll be there in 5 minutes. Bring kanna outside.

1322
02:16:44,104 --> 02:16:47,360
You leave. I’m going home now.

1323
02:18:01,811 --> 02:18:02,852
Sir is calling.. come.

1324
02:18:16,903 --> 02:18:18,789
Take your brother and go home.

1325
02:19:27,250 --> 02:19:27,859
He is my son.

1326
02:19:28,079 --> 02:19:32,239
I know, it is because of him that
we are talking about marriage.

1327
02:19:37,300 --> 02:19:40,554
I'm here to talk about the marriage preparation.
-One minute.

1328
02:19:44,123 --> 02:19:47,648
Let’s fix upon a date and time
for the wedding proceedings.

1329
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:52,757
You can talk to my son about it.

1330
02:19:55,568 --> 02:19:56,742
We’ll approve to whatever he says.

1331
02:20:34,353 --> 02:20:35,833
I don’t want anything. Take it off.

1332
02:20:36,513 --> 02:20:38,153
I said I don’t want anything. Go away!

1333
02:20:44,759 --> 02:20:46,378
Did you call me, sir? -Take me out.

1334
02:20:46,781 --> 02:20:48,101
Doctors advised otherwise, sir.

1335
02:20:48,919 --> 02:20:49,363
Go away!

1336
02:20:53,550 --> 02:20:54,730
Shall I call Srinu?

1337
02:20:57,137 --> 02:20:57,683
No.

1338
02:20:58,950 --> 02:21:03,183
Let him live his life. Don’t disturb him.

1339
02:21:38,793 --> 02:21:42,839
Tell me, sir..
-Can you meet Vikram?

1340
02:21:42,999 --> 02:21:43,683
Of course, sir..

1341
02:21:47,511 --> 02:21:48,121
What happened, sir?

1342
02:21:50,277 --> 02:21:53,288
I thought he’d miss nothing in life after the Paris trip.

1343
02:21:53,336 --> 02:21:55,656
But he’s missing life after you left.

1344
02:21:56,873 --> 02:21:58,160
He asked me not to call you..

1345
02:21:59,202 --> 02:22:00,949
But I got scared looking at his condition.

1346
02:22:01,864 --> 02:22:02,261
Go...

1347
02:22:11,277 --> 02:22:11,894
Brother..

1348
02:22:31,229 --> 02:22:34,429
What’s this, brother?
Why do you look like heartbroken kid?

1349
02:22:38,128 --> 02:22:38,918
Srinu..

1350
02:22:40,597 --> 02:22:43,988
I’m unable to breathe here. Let’s go out.

1351
02:23:29,532 --> 02:23:30,347
What do we do now?

1352
02:23:32,694 --> 02:23:33,738
Let me decide that.

1353
02:24:18,514 --> 02:24:19,517
See..

1354
02:24:22,311 --> 02:24:26,127
Just the hat and you’ll look like Quickgun Murugan.
-It doesn’t look good.

1355
02:24:32,158 --> 02:24:36,619
You look like a villain from Bruce Lee’s movies.
-Are you playing around with me?

1356
02:24:36,896 --> 02:24:37,963
It’s been long, right?

1357
02:24:48,993 --> 02:24:51,259
You look like Cupid now.

1358
02:24:51,776 --> 02:24:54,176
What will happen to the girls
if you grow your beard?

1359
02:24:56,591 --> 02:25:00,502
I was a plain sheet of paper.
You turned me into a painting.

1360
02:25:01,927 --> 02:25:04,487
When you asked me to go with my mother,
I was scared.

1361
02:25:04,976 --> 02:25:07,486
But when I was with her I realised..

1362
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:10,377
You don’t need money to live.

1363
02:25:11,428 --> 02:25:14,010
Even one soul who loves you is enough
to get you through life.

1364
02:25:15,919 --> 02:25:20,400
What you need now is not an attender
who wipes away your tears.

1365
02:25:20,774 --> 02:25:22,908
But a companion
who does not let you shed tears.

1366
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:25,846
That day you asked me to leave.

1367
02:25:27,019 --> 02:25:27,924
I am leaving now.

1368
02:25:36,989 --> 02:25:38,408
You can’t escape from here now.

1369
02:25:40,261 --> 02:25:42,111
Your hands and legs don’t move.

1370
02:25:43,102 --> 02:25:44,479
Your heart’s still beating.

1371
02:25:46,661 --> 02:25:47,674
Don’t stop it.

1372
02:25:52,318 --> 02:25:53,135
Hey, Srinu!

1373
02:25:54,134 --> 02:25:54,549
Srinu!

1374
02:25:55,463 --> 02:25:55,963
Srinu.

1375
02:26:44,148 --> 02:26:45,291
How are you, Vikram?

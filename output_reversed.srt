1
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,356
You haven’t changed.

2
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:21,809
I learnt that from you.

3
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,825
Stop.. Stop..

4
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,005
Stop.. stop..

5
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:41,825
Stop! Stop!

6
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:48,364
Hello.. control room.

7
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:02,267
I can bet Rs.10, 000. They won’t catch up with me. -Game.

8
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:18,894
I told you they wouldn’t be able to catch up with us.
Ten thousand…

9
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:29,520
What happened to your bet?

10
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:35,166
It’s my turn to bet Rs. 10,000.
These policemen will escort us.

11
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:37,434
What? -Get out of the car.

12
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:39,512
How dare you speed away without stopping?
Are you drunk?

13
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,177
I don’t drink. -Blow!!

14
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:42,497
Blow it properly.

15
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:51,177
What’s this, sir? Will you kill me?
Won’t you help an innocent?

16
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:53,622
Look at him...
he’s critical. I’m taking him to the hospital.

17
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,083
He can’t even move his limbs.

18
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,448
Look at him, sir.

19
00:04:57,738 --> 00:04:59,637
Did you see that? If anything happens to him,

20
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:02,422
I’ll tell the media that you are responsible.

21
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,833
No, sir. Please check. I’ll go only after that.

22
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:06,622
Go away! -No, sir. Please check. I’ll go only after that.

23
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:09,630
Go away. Leave! Why are you dragging it?

24
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:11,653
Get into the car, Take him to the hospital.

25
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:13,137
Hey, bring the car.

26
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:15,192
Are they escorting us?

27
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:24,161
I suggest, we’ll go ahead.
You follow us. We’ll clear the road for you.

28
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:27,278
Is that okay? -Yes.

29
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:28,505
Good, Just follow us.

30
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:32,239
Turn on the siren, sir.

31
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,356
Hey, turn on the siren.

32
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,591
Stop. They left.

33
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:41,419
You acted very well. -Learnt it from you, right?

34
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,161
I win 20,000. -Alright.

35
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:50,567
I just have one childhood wish...
-To be escorted by the cops. It’s finally fulfilled.

36
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:24,697
The inspector is coming. -What?

37
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:25,767
The inspector is coming!

38
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:30,023
Is he all right? -Ok sir..

39
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:33,143
Bring a stretcher?
-Please don’t trouble yourself.
I will manage

40
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:36,230
Just one man like you can make a
difference to the police force…

41
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:41,717
Actually that's my job.. -Please carry on. I will manage.

42
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:42,760
Take care.

43
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:51,885
What do we do now?

44
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,322
-I will decide that.

45
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,861
Lingam Uncle...

46
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:44,564
How are you uncle.. -Hey.. hey.

47
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,935
You’ve no clue how much I missed you.
-Inside the jail?

48
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:50,706
I was told that I’ve been given a ‘role’. What is it?

49
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,322
Yes, you’ve been given the ‘role’ of ‘Kattappa’
in the movie ‘Baahubali 2’.

50
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:54,783
Don’t make fun of me.

51
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:56,642
You have been released on ‘parole’.

52
00:09:57,136 --> 00:10:00,736
You’ve been sentenced to two years of imprisonment.

53
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:03,830
I’ve battled the last six months
to get you a 4-month parole.

54
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:06,369
These four months, You must maintain good conduct.

55
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,252
Can you explain it in Telugu?

56
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,181
I am speaking in Telugu, right?

57
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:15,183
Good conduct as in well mannered.

58
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:21,063
Henceforth, you must do good to the society
and prove that you’re harmless.

59
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:23,674
The court will close your case
if they believe that you’ve changed.

60
00:10:23,704 --> 00:10:25,720
What if they don’t believe?
-You’ll be sent back to jail.

61
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,463
Back to jail. No way! I will listen to you.

62
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:34,666
Hey, Srinu... -You’re hopeless gang is here.

63
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,619
Hey, Srinu...

64
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:39,049
You’re a hero, dude. -What’s all this?

65
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:41,183
Because you’ve been released from the jail.

66
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:43,663
So much for coming back from the prison.
Felicitations and cheers!

67
00:10:43,663 --> 00:10:45,583
Uncle, come here. -I’m coming.

68
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:54,918
Go..

69
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,356
That’s irrelevant. You must tell me.

70
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:21,457
Where has mother gone?

71
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:23,043
She hasn’t gone yet. She is alive.

72
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:51,503
Where are you going?

73
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:56,784
I’ve told you so many times
not to be in the company of those boys.

74
00:11:56,856 --> 00:11:58,296
Who are you to question me?

75
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:00,637
Are you trying to act big
because you are my older brother?

76
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:02,137
Have you forgotten that you’ve just come out of jail?

77
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:03,746
Don’t lecture me.

78
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:22,989
Swathi? -Mother.. Mother’s here. I’ll call you back

79
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:43,090
Why did you come back?

80
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:46,391
I thought you would go away.

81
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,880
Why did you come back?

82
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:52,114
I believed you would change
and take over my responsibilities.

83
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:54,512
You shattered my belief six months back.

84
00:12:54,831 --> 00:12:57,090
We’ve got used to the idea of living a life without you.

85
00:12:57,536 --> 00:13:00,096
It never occurs to you that
you have a brother and sister…

86
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:02,207
Your sister…

87
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,036
Sorry… My Daughter.

88
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:11,075
Nobody wants to marry my daughter
because her brother went to prison.

89
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,121
Your brother is disobedient just like you.
He is whiling away time on the roadside.

90
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:21,568
I am scared thinking of things
that could happen because you are around.

91
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:24,012
Go away.

92
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:26,770
Mother...

93
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:34,442
We don’t need you here.
Leave now.

94
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:59,304
Are you drinking because you’ve been released from the jail?
Or because your mother disowned you?

95
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:00,442
Give us some clarity.

96
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,075
What the hell is wrong with my mother?

97
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:04,715
Why does she expect me to be like her?

98
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:09,731
She wakes up early, does all the work at home,
packs her lunch and goes to work.

99
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:17,973
She has to salute all her superiors at work.
She is exhausted when she returns home.

100
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:21,676
At the end of the month,
she has no money left even for her bus fare.

101
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:22,996
How can one lead a life like that?

102
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:25,090
I don’t understand how they can live such a life?

103
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:31,223
If the police hadn’t caught us,
our lives would have been different.

104
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:40,778
You can be charged for drinking in a public place.

105
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:43,973
Your parole will be cancelled
and you have to serve extra time in the jail.

106
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:46,864
Where are you? -I am on Google.

107
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,864
I will call you tomorrow. Wind up and leave.

108
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,624
Where do I go?

109
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:04,786
Have you brought me to an orphanage because
I have been thrown out of my house?

110
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:11,153
This orphanage is for little children.
Not for grownups like you.

111
00:15:11,992 --> 00:15:12,598
Come along.

112
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:15,658
What should I do here?
-They need a volunteer to look after the children.

113
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:20,671
If you do some good deeds, the court will close your case.

114
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:22,528
Good conduct, remember?

115
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:25,114
You’ve an interview now. Let’s go.
-An interview? Yeah.

116
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:29,033
Tell me? -Here’s the nice guy
I was talking to you about.

117
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:31,513
What were you doing before this?

118
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:32,754
I got out of jail only yesterday.

119
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,676
Didn’t you tell him?

120
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:45,176
Why did you tell him that you were in jail?
-You asked me to maintain good conduct, right?

121
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:49,504
I’m diabetic. I can’t take this!

122
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:51,231
Where are we going next?

123
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,325
You must wake up at 5 in the morning. -That early?

124
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,703
Listen to me...

125
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:01,456
You have to wake him up by 6 am
and get him ready by 7am.

126
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:02,067
Let's go.

127
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:10,224
At 11 pm…

128
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:13,114
Wait, When do I go to sleep?

129
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,379
Good Question, I will show you the bedroom.

130
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:19,004
Will I have my own bedroom?
-Yes, we shall provide with attached bathroom, come..

131
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:24,692
You call this a bedroom.
-Yes.

132
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,241
That is the bed and this is the room.

133
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,270
That’s the bathroom.

134
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:38,840
Do you like it?

135
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:46,479
You look like a ‘Clean India’ evangelist.
What happened?

136
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:49,747
This is a very difficult job.
Being in jail is easier.
Over there I have 10 people to work for me.

137
00:16:50,055 --> 00:16:52,411
But here, I have to do 10 men’s work.
This won’t work out.

138
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,435
Find me a job where I have to work for just one person.
You have the nerve to be choosy?

139
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:58,177
Uncle, where are we going?

140
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:02,302
You asked me to look for one person, right?
I found one.

141
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:05,146
But you won’t fit the cadre.

142
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:08,505
Who are you do decide that? Let’s just go there.

143
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,887
Uncle... -Yes.

144
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,395
This is my thing. -yeah, right!

145
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,801
I can do this for 4 years and not 4 months.

146
00:17:28,657 --> 00:17:29,669
Go inside..

147
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,864
How do they make so much money?

148
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:53,630
They fired so many people at once?

149
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:55,724
I stand no chance.

150
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:01,149
I should definitely get this job.

151
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:00,153
Hey, Who is he?

152
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:02,368
You don’t know him? -No.

153
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:06,214
Vikramaditya, A leading businessman. In fortune 500...
-That’s enough.

154
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,008
Who is that girl who followed him inside?

155
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:10,563
That’s his secretary.

156
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:15,212
Where can we find such girls?
I don’t get to see any on the road.

157
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:17,759
She is mine.

158
00:19:18,535 --> 00:19:20,655
I meant the job. -The job is mine.

159
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:23,485
Rambabu.. -Sir.

160
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,157
Good morning sir..

161
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:31,181
Why did you choose this job?

162
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:36,113
My blood group is O Positive.
Helping people is in my blood.

163
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:40,618
I haven’t kept a photo of my mother in my house.
I’ve only hung a photo of Mother Theresa.

164
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,683
A lot of people have said that
they feel a ‘positive vibration’ around me.

165
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:44,548
Sudhakar.

166
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,632
Why did you choose this job?

167
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,719
I’ve been nursing a 90 years old man.

168
00:19:49,783 --> 00:19:53,267
He’s passed away last week.
He said he’d miss me before he died.

169
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:57,032
He said life would be good if one had
someone like me for company.

170
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:01,103
I am soft-hearted.
I’ve also done my M.B.A.

171
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:04,376
I can also manage your business.

172
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:05,868
What is your ambition?

173
00:20:05,975 --> 00:20:06,455
Money.

174
00:20:06,512 --> 00:20:07,759
Humanitarianism.

175
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,571
Service.

176
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:39,454
Sridhar.. -Sir.

177
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:41,876
Wait. How long should I wait here?

178
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:43,399
Where do these guys come from!

179
00:20:57,353 --> 00:20:58,774
Why did you choose this job?

180
00:20:58,962 --> 00:21:04,985
I liked the house at first sight and
I also liked you at first sight.

181
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:17,001
Have you done this kind of work earlier?
-Do you mean social service?

182
00:21:17,988 --> 00:21:24,588
I was 4. I nursed an injured dog on
the road and gave some food.

183
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:28,767
I donated blood on Powerstar’s birthday.
I donated my friend’s eyes on Superstar’s birthday.

184
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:33,985
I donated food on Rebelstar’s birthday.
I just donated something at an orphanage.

185
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,274
I’d never say all that.

186
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:41,956
Uncle Lingam is insisting that
I maintain good conduct and that’s why I’m here.

187
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,306
What’s your ambition?

188
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:47,517
I don’t have any big ambition.
I have a different one every day.

189
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:50,173
Today, my ambition is to woo her.

190
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:54,165
Can I have your phone number?

191
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:56,337
Oh.. it's alright.

192
00:21:58,189 --> 00:21:59,040
Here’s my number.

193
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:04,885
I’ve free outgoing after 10. I’ll call you back
if you give me a missed call.

194
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:07,657
See ya!

195
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:11,259
What’s your name?

196
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:15,767
Srinu. -You’ve always been dependable.

197
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,337
Yes, Just like you.

198
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,038
What are you talking. Do you have sense?

199
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:25,126
You’ll say whatever you want?
Do you have any sense? Idiot.

200
00:22:25,587 --> 00:22:26,462
You are appointed.

201
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:31,642
What? -You can join tomorrow.

202
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,962
Hey! Who are you?

203
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:44,938
Where are you going?

204
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:46,399
Who are you?

205
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:50,767
I’ve been the chief servant
of this mansion for 30 years.

206
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:52,463
A servant?

207
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,642
I was worried if you were the owner.

208
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:57,079
You are late on your very first day at work!

209
00:22:58,054 --> 00:23:01,813
Who is this fellow?
He is the new caretaker appointed by the boss.

210
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:03,056
This fellow!

211
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:04,626
Come along.

212
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:08,556
Go and get a strong cup of coffee for me. -Get lost!

213
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:12,157
You have to wake up at 6
every morning and get ready.

214
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:13,798
Wake up the boss at 7 am and serve him coffee.

215
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:15,543
His physiotherapist will be here at 8 am sharp.

216
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:18,583
Learn all the exercises from the physiotherapist.
It will be your job from now on.

217
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:20,978
You have to serve breakfast at 9 am.

218
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:24,548
Breakfast? I already had mine.

219
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:28,954
Have this walkie-talkie with you.

220
00:23:29,637 --> 00:23:32,235
You’ll be able to hear his instructions here.

221
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:34,196
You must react in no time.

222
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:37,345
There is one more important thing
that I have to say.

223
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:38,313
What is it?

224
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:40,587
Don’t waste your time following me around.

225
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:43,868
Meenakshi said the
same thing when I met her first.

226
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:46,009
Who is Meenakshi? -My ex-girlfriend.

227
00:23:49,315 --> 00:23:50,134
This is your room.

228
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:58,259
Is this my room?

229
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:01,485
You have to keep the room clean and in order. -Ok.

230
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,274
This is your bathroom.

231
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:18,603
This looks like the ones
I’ve seen in the Hollywood movies.

232
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:20,767
Come, let us go and meet the boss.

233
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:22,970
Give me 2 minutes. -Ok, hurry up.

234
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,048
Why are you looking at me?

235
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:39,853
Thank you. That’s an awesome bathroom.

236
00:24:42,446 --> 00:24:45,238
What are you doing?

237
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,048
I didn’t know he is a quadriplegic.
Thought it was only his legs.

238
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:54,154
Sir, I don’t think this fellow will last a week.

239
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,063
Why are you wasting your time on him?

240
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:00,141
Looking at some people, you just wish you could
spend the rest of your life here.

241
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:05,681
My job is to just take care of you. Right?
Why is she making a big fuss?

242
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:07,720
You will understand as time goes by.

243
00:25:09,415 --> 00:25:12,543
Fold.. Stretch... watch carefully.

244
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:16,063
Every bone and muscle of your body must move.

245
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,017
You must not forget that.
He must exercise in the morning and evening.

246
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:23,009
Without fail. And be very careful, okay?

247
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:25,415
Did you get it?

248
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:29,149
Hey!

249
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:32,368
After hands... -I was doing the legs now. Not hands.

250
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:37,099
Did you notice how she is doing?

251
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:40,001
I saw everything.
-Make him sit on the wheelchair.

252
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:46,001
Lift him up.

253
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:04,563
Anything else?

254
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,696
Buckle him up.

255
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,876
You should have been careful.
-How would I know? You should have told me.

256
00:26:18,214 --> 00:26:20,345
Give him a bath.

257
00:26:20,642 --> 00:26:22,196
What did you say? -Give him a bath.

258
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:24,251
I can’t give him a bath.

259
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:32,407
What next?

260
00:26:32,665 --> 00:26:35,384
These regulate the blood circulation in his legs.

261
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:37,634
I gave him a bath. My work ends there.
I can’t do all this.

262
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,837
Keerthi, he will do it.
You leave.

263
00:26:40,923 --> 00:26:45,087
You can’t expect me to do everything just because
you’ve given me a luxurious bathroom.

264
00:26:58,205 --> 00:26:58,946
It's alright.

265
00:27:04,017 --> 00:27:04,720
Thanks.

266
00:27:04,938 --> 00:27:08,863
Uncle, you didn’t tell me before.
Must brush his teeth, give him a shower, oil his hair.

267
00:27:08,985 --> 00:27:11,103
I can’t do all that. Look for something else.
-Hey, idiot.

268
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:13,376
Almost everybody has rejected you.

269
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,381
I wonder how he liked you. Bear with it for four months.

270
00:27:18,644 --> 00:27:22,204
After yoru case is closed, I’ll talk to Anwar
from Sharjah and fix up something for you.

271
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:23,564
I’m at the court. Hang up now.

272
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:24,984
Hello.. hello..

273
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:28,649
4 months?

274
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:32,053
Srinu.. Srinu...

275
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:35,022
Srinu.. Srinu...

276
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:36,446
Srinu.. -What, sir?

277
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:37,383
I want water.

278
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,024
Good morning, sir. -Good morning.

279
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:57,197
Hey.. Srinu!

280
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,798
Must send that to the lawyer, Keep it in the brown file.

281
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:07,610
That’s personal. Keep it in the black one.

282
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,228
What are you doing?

283
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:34,251
It’s so hot and he can’t feel a thing.

284
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:36,048
Idiot.

285
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:38,622
Are you playing with me?

286
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:40,298
Can’t you feel anything, sir?

287
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:54,348
Hello.. Okay, I’ll call back later.

288
00:28:55,843 --> 00:28:56,407
Sir..

289
00:28:57,173 --> 00:29:00,462
Calling you sir feels like I’m back to school.
And I always hated school.

290
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:02,353
Usually I call everyone with some relation.

291
00:29:02,864 --> 00:29:04,899
Can I call you...
-What do you wanna call me?

292
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,392
Can I call you brother?

293
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,743
What’s this, brother?

294
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,001
Where do such girls live?

295
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,962
Paris. -Did you ever go?

296
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,532
Many times. It’s my favourite city.

297
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:33,493
Whenever I felt stressed I’d escape to Paris.

298
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,030
Get me a bottle of alcohol when you go next time.

299
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:44,493
You’ve so many cars parked here.

300
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,134
Which one should we hop into?

301
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,782
We’re not going in a car. We are taking the van.

302
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:51,954
This is not a van. It’s an ambulance.

303
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:54,001
You’re not a patient to commute in that.

304
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:58,587
Doctors say that
it’s not right for me to commute in a car.

305
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:03,877
You rich people, listen to your doctors and babas.

306
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:07,596
I’m not up for an ambulance. Choose a car!

307
00:30:07,828 --> 00:30:08,907
Which car do you like?

308
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:18,549
Why does it sound like that, brother? -Go on.

309
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:26,415
I’m scared what he’ll do next.

310
00:30:48,571 --> 00:30:53,657
It’s been an hour. How long willl you stare
at a white board with red paint, brother?

311
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,149
That painting is talking to me, Srinu.

312
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:00,532
I can’t hear anything.

313
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:02,837
Do you know the greatness of art?

314
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:07,259
You must tell me..
-It remains even after we’re dead and gone.

315
00:31:07,525 --> 00:31:11,399
Stop it, brother. The only thing that’ll
remain is a photo frame hanging on the wall.

316
00:31:12,756 --> 00:31:14,118
what’s the price? -20 Lakhs.

317
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:15,444
What?

318
00:31:16,045 --> 00:31:18,235
He bought a painting worth 20 Lakhs.

319
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:21,337
Just imagine the number of pegs
I’d get in the same amount.

320
00:31:22,363 --> 00:31:23,767
Hang up. I need to go.

321
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:25,204
Hello..

322
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:33,212
Hi, Vikram. -Hi.

323
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:36,926
Sorry. I’m late.
-It’s a routine for lawyers, right?

324
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:40,853
I'm not here as your company’s legal advisor.
-You had something important to say.

325
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:42,373
You selected someone I believe.

326
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:45,610
You liked him of all you interviewed?

327
00:31:46,725 --> 00:31:49,665
He spilled hot water on your legs
to check if you can feel it.

328
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:51,798
Stupid fellow.  Do you know who he is?

329
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:55,243
A thief. He’s out on parole.

330
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:05,095
They are not kind and compassionate.

331
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:09,013
What if he harms you flee away, we’d be helpless.

332
00:32:10,173 --> 00:32:12,618
You know your condition, right?
You should have given it a thought.

333
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:16,571
That’s it? Or there’s more?

334
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:21,087
It’s been 5 years since the accident.

335
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:26,021
Why do you all pity my life on wheelchair?

336
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:28,454
I can’t take it.

337
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:30,173
It’s annoying.

338
00:32:31,671 --> 00:32:34,915
Whatever you just said to me was also out of pity.

339
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:38,259
Exactly, he doesn’t pity me.

340
00:32:39,781 --> 00:32:41,015
I want that.

341
00:32:42,346 --> 00:32:47,796
He asks me to talk on the phone
and completely ignores that I’m paralysed.

342
00:32:48,589 --> 00:32:50,499
I don’t care about his past.

343
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:55,517
I need someone like him in my life right now.

344
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:02,108
You were saying something? About him harming me...

345
00:33:03,726 --> 00:33:05,523
I’ve no hopes from my life anymore.

346
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,945
Why would I fear that
he will do something to me.

347
00:33:10,548 --> 00:33:12,249
You never listen to me anyway.

348
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:17,167
In this world, he is of no use to anyone except you.

349
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,034
Srinu.

350
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:24,298
Brother?

351
00:33:24,444 --> 00:33:27,084
Srinu, meet my best friend Prasad.

352
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:31,807
Sir, I think I’ve seen you before.

353
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:37,198
You’re an antagonist from Hindi dubbed films, right?

354
00:33:45,593 --> 00:33:46,245
See you, sir.

355
00:33:47,381 --> 00:33:48,120
Stupid fellow.

356
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:56,120
I’ve decided today, brother.
All you need is money to live the way you want.

357
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:56,752
What?

358
00:33:56,964 --> 00:34:01,063
Look, your hands and legs don’t work.
Still you’re living life king size

359
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:02,893
That’s the power of money.

360
00:34:04,268 --> 00:34:09,143
A painting worth 20 lakhs. That’s life!

361
00:34:33,844 --> 00:34:38,650
Hey, you think I can’t do it. Now, look here.

362
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,072
Sorry.

363
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,135
Brother.

364
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:14,994
Brother, what happened?

365
00:35:25,985 --> 00:35:27,815
Nothing will happen...

366
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:39,135
Nothing will happen, brother.

367
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:05,018
Brother..

368
00:36:05,392 --> 00:36:07,541
I can’t breathe.

369
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:11,877
Get me out of here.

370
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:28,055
Where are we going?
-You wanted to get out, right?

371
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:32,760
I meant to the lawn.

372
00:36:33,463 --> 00:36:36,205
You breathe that air all the time.
-Where are you taking me now?

373
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:51,940
They don’t sell that.

374
00:36:53,392 --> 00:36:55,955
I’m scared you’ll ask its price.

375
00:36:57,408 --> 00:36:58,322
What happened to you before?

376
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,918
It’s a minor medical issue.
-A medical problem?

377
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:04,776
Stop it, brother.
You’d feel that way if you sit in the house all the time.

378
00:37:05,783 --> 00:37:11,111
You must go out sometimes.
Not just salads you must eat dum biriyani too.

379
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:18,651
Not just AC cars you must go on bike rides too.

380
00:37:20,837 --> 00:37:22,104
Me? One  a bike?

381
00:37:22,985 --> 00:37:24,666
You can’t hop on?

382
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:30,479
Let’s exchange our vehicles for 30 minutes

383
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,635
Brother, shall we ride?

384
00:37:46,072 --> 00:37:48,221
You must also get a bike like this. -What?

385
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:50,104
You must get a bike..

386
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:51,861
only then will I get a chance..

387
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:45,744
Your eyes are watering because of the
wind against your face.

388
00:38:48,182 --> 00:38:49,994
That’s not why my eyes are watering.

389
00:40:56,764 --> 00:40:57,264
That is personal.

390
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:02,718
Did you paint? -Yes, brother. I painted it.

391
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:07,654
You paid 20 lakhs for one colour.
I used so many here. I might get 2 lakhs at least.

392
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:12,540
What were you thinking?
-An artist doesn’t reveal what he feels.

393
00:43:12,714 --> 00:43:14,198
The viewer must understand that.

394
00:43:16,076 --> 00:43:17,196
How is the painting?

395
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:21,718
I couldn’t find the toilet brush. Did you take it?

396
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,597
Get lost!

397
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:27,981
it’s like you painted it with your face.

398
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,237
Place it at the entrance. It’ll purge away evil’s eye.

399
00:43:30,386 --> 00:43:32,343
A painter who can’t handle his pants!

400
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:39,534
He’s like a flower to my stem. Hello?

401
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:42,539
Anwar called me from Sharjah this morning.
He got me a job there.

402
00:43:42,726 --> 00:43:45,606
I must go away once the case is closed.
You better take care of the arrangements.

403
00:43:45,663 --> 00:43:49,183
Why are you in a hurry?
-I’ll exhaust my balance. Recharge my mobile for Rs. 500

404
00:43:51,143 --> 00:43:52,051
One spicy omelette.

405
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:55,581
Are you leaving? -Not right now, After 3 months.

406
00:43:56,941 --> 00:43:59,699
Vikram, you’re trying to me avoid me.

407
00:44:00,116 --> 00:44:04,916
But I can’t forget you and
I know you can’t forget me either.

408
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,103
Oh, no!

409
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,324
Look. All you need is money. -Ah?

410
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:14,035
I was wondering why isn’t she falling for me.
Now you know.

411
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:17,157
What? -Didn’t you hear that? Kirthi is hitting on him.

412
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,678
You’ve no control on what you say.
Do you have sense?

413
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:22,613
She’s reading his letter.

414
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,137
What?

415
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,473
A letter? -Yes. A letter.

416
00:44:26,746 --> 00:44:29,063
The blue one, the personal one.

417
00:44:29,157 --> 00:44:29,512
The same one.

418
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:30,668
What’s the matter?

419
00:44:37,112 --> 00:44:40,552
Promise me you won’t tell anyone.

420
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:41,723
Tell me quickly.

421
00:44:44,797 --> 00:44:47,997
He visits these art exhibitions very often, right?

422
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:54,909
He liked a painting and
wrote a letter to an artist. Guess who she is.

423
00:44:55,149 --> 00:44:57,277
Who? -A girl.

424
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:58,480
Superb.

425
00:44:59,004 --> 00:45:02,743
They’ve been writing to each other
for over a year now. -And then...?

426
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:08,543
6 months ago, the girl said she likes him.

427
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:11,582
And that she wants to meet him. -Amazing.

428
00:45:12,198 --> 00:45:14,949
Since then he stopped replying to her letters.

429
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:18,348
Is it? -that girl is continuing to write to him.

430
00:45:21,894 --> 00:45:26,518
How can they not meet and write to each other. How?

431
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:28,879
Ask him only. -Correct.

432
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:31,943
hey.. hey.. hey.. -Trust me, I’ll take care of it.

433
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:33,423
-Stop. I beg you.

434
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,832
Damn, I can never keep a secret.

435
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:38,785
I hope you’ll change your mind someday.

436
00:45:39,254 --> 00:45:40,903
Srinu, wait outside for 5 minutes.

437
00:45:41,013 --> 00:45:43,129
What? -Wait for 5 minutes.

438
00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:46,749
You must turn it off if it’s personal.

439
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:49,934
Now it’s public.
Your servant has broadcasted the information already.

440
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:52,113
Hey. -Srinu.

441
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,762
How dare you take the letter. Give it back.
-What’s this, brother?

442
00:45:55,029 --> 00:45:58,793
Despite all the chasing she ain’t falling for me.
And you don’t care about the girl who fell for you.

443
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,504
That’s too much, brother. This is against the nature.

444
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:03,379
Her phone number is here.

445
00:46:03,638 --> 00:46:06,518
My outgoing costs are very reasonable.
-Don’t call her, Srinu. No, don’t call her.

446
00:46:06,757 --> 00:46:07,598
Please, Srinu.

447
00:46:09,053 --> 00:46:11,013
Hang up. Srinu, stop it!

448
00:46:11,181 --> 00:46:12,301
Srinu. -Hello.

449
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,310
Her voice is amazing. talk to her. -Hello.

450
00:46:16,465 --> 00:46:17,943
No. -Talk!

451
00:46:18,054 --> 00:46:19,707
Talk! -Hello.

452
00:46:20,437 --> 00:46:21,723
Hello.. -Priya.

453
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:27,691
This is Vikram.
I’ve been meaning to call you. But couldn’t.

454
00:46:27,974 --> 00:46:29,738
Just a minute. I’ll pass on the phone to Priya.

455
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,902
The feeling is amazing. Continue with the flow.

456
00:46:34,741 --> 00:46:36,269
Talk to her. What are you doing there? Come here.

457
00:46:37,749 --> 00:46:38,285
Hello..

458
00:46:38,854 --> 00:46:39,418
Vikram.

459
00:46:44,014 --> 00:46:46,191
Talk to her, brother.

460
00:46:49,463 --> 00:46:49,941
Priya.

461
00:46:52,884 --> 00:46:53,402
Vikram..

462
00:46:54,597 --> 00:46:56,551
Hey, where is Vikram?

463
00:46:57,423 --> 00:46:58,176
He’s busy.

464
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,207
He was avoiding the phone yesterday.
Today, he isn’t leaving it.

465
00:47:03,557 --> 00:47:04,660
Who is it?

466
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:07,059
It’s personal.

467
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:10,051
It’ll take only 5 minutes, Please be seated.

468
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,960
This painting is for me? -Yes.

469
00:47:22,358 --> 00:47:23,824
Yes, from where did you get?

470
00:47:24,827 --> 00:47:25,988
From London. -WoW!

471
00:47:26,645 --> 00:47:27,832
How much? - Two Lakhs.

472
00:47:32,379 --> 00:47:33,012
How is it?

473
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,371
I don't understand what this artist conveying.

474
00:47:36,118 --> 00:47:38,238
What is this Prasad, I expected you to recognize it.

475
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,333
Yes, I didn't see it properly.

476
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:41,879
Let me see.

477
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:52,480
Yes! I got it.

478
00:47:53,341 --> 00:47:57,269
That Red, Yellow, Blue and Orange.

479
00:47:57,806 --> 00:47:59,746
They are expressing the feelings of a Human.

480
00:48:00,142 --> 00:48:02,543
Prasad, you're a Genius.

481
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:03,684
Thank you.

482
00:48:06,029 --> 00:48:06,707
I'll buy it.

483
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:11,027
You know my taste. -Yes, very well.

484
00:48:15,178 --> 00:48:17,423
Sir, we got the land contact and we checked it and... -
Did you call me, brother?

485
00:48:17,509 --> 00:48:19,309
Yes, bring me that cover.

486
00:48:24,787 --> 00:48:25,459
What’s all this, brother?

487
00:48:25,957 --> 00:48:27,530
That’s the amount you got for your painting. Two Lakhs.

488
00:48:29,663 --> 00:48:31,006
My painting? -Yes.

489
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:34,740
This is the first time I earned so much money.

490
00:48:36,868 --> 00:48:38,389
This is the first time ever I made money.

491
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,405
I used to get weird feelings
when I saw white paper as a child.

492
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,630
To do something. To draw something.
I didn’t understand anything back then.

493
00:48:48,901 --> 00:48:51,475
But now I know... No one can stop me now, brother.

494
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:55,589
No one can stop me. I’ll prove myself.
I’ll continue to paint.

495
00:49:09,734 --> 00:49:12,186
It’s been really long I saw you.

496
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:14,920
Well...

497
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:20,061
(Phone ringing)

498
00:49:25,069 --> 00:49:25,694
What’s this?

499
00:49:26,545 --> 00:49:28,694
Srinu asked me to give this to you.

500
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:30,436
What?

501
00:49:30,743 --> 00:49:32,423
Srinu asked me to give you this money.

502
00:49:41,285 --> 00:49:42,248
He’ll never change.

503
00:49:52,645 --> 00:49:57,537
Tell him that he’s distanced himself
a little more from the family.

504
00:49:59,525 --> 00:50:04,069
I’ve been the breadwinner of this family.
And will continue to be.

505
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:07,170
We don’t need his sympathy. Leave!

506
00:50:10,012 --> 00:50:13,372
I told you, right?
Your mother will never believe you.

507
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,264
What are you doing, dude?
What do you have to do with him?

508
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:25,858
Once again... Brother... I’ll see you in the evening.

509
00:50:26,285 --> 00:50:26,936
You leave now.

510
00:50:29,237 --> 00:50:29,709
Hey!

511
00:50:30,877 --> 00:50:32,022
Go away!

512
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:43,981
Sir, you’ve got some mails. -Any letters?

513
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:49,398
Yes, sir. One from TIME magazine,
one from the bank and one is a wedding card.

514
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:52,069
That’s it. Anything else? -That’s all, sir.

515
00:50:53,476 --> 00:50:54,998
Okay, leave me alone.

516
00:50:55,773 --> 00:50:57,037
Yes sir. -Srinu.

517
00:50:57,932 --> 00:50:58,522
Even you can leave.

518
00:51:02,196 --> 00:51:02,944
Brother..

519
00:51:03,989 --> 00:51:06,631
Were you talking about this letter?

520
00:51:08,436 --> 00:51:10,928
But this doesn’t look like a letter. Is it a photograph?

521
00:51:11,155 --> 00:51:13,998
Matters have moved from phone to photo.
-Srinu! Leave the letter here.

522
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,463
Hey, Srinu!
listen to me, Srinu.

523
00:51:16,987 --> 00:51:18,397
Srinu.. No No No!

524
00:51:24,613 --> 00:51:26,951
Brother, you are so done.

525
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,584
There’s something written behind.

526
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:47,155
Coming to Hyderabad on the 11th.
Hope we can catch up.

527
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:49,530
Hello, subtitles!

528
00:51:50,868 --> 00:51:52,701
Read it in Telugu, I must understand, right?

529
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:56,605
She’s coming to Hyderabad on 11th
and was asking if he could catch up.

530
00:51:56,957 --> 00:51:59,437
We are so catching up. Right, brother?
What do you think, brother?

531
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:03,834
How is it brother?

532
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:08,084
Even I thought the same, This doesn't suit.

533
00:52:12,558 --> 00:52:13,076
Its not good.

534
00:52:14,748 --> 00:52:15,569
This is too good.

535
00:52:16,429 --> 00:52:19,061
Don’t drag the matter any further,
We must take a decision.

536
00:52:20,026 --> 00:52:21,006
Srinu... -What’s it, brother?

537
00:52:21,581 --> 00:52:22,865
You can’t come with me. -Why?

538
00:52:23,572 --> 00:52:24,444
You talk too much.

539
00:52:26,613 --> 00:52:27,303
All right, brother.

540
00:52:29,134 --> 00:52:30,694
But you don’t talk too little.

541
00:52:39,013 --> 00:52:40,162
Kirthi... -Yes sir.

542
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,397
What’s the time?

543
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:44,884
5.40 -We have 20 minutes more.

544
00:52:50,686 --> 00:52:51,733
Kirthi.. -Sir?

545
00:52:52,091 --> 00:52:53,013
What’s the time?

546
00:52:53,714 --> 00:52:54,319
5.50

547
00:52:59,083 --> 00:52:59,811
What’s the time?

548
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:03,990
5.51, sir..

549
00:53:05,044 --> 00:53:05,647
Let’s go..

550
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:10,850
There’s 5 minutes more, sir.
-I said, let’s go!

551
00:53:31,655 --> 00:53:33,076
What’s it, brother? You didn’t meet her?

552
00:53:33,637 --> 00:53:36,975
That’s why you asked me to stay away?
I was right there. Something’s scaring you

553
00:53:38,201 --> 00:53:40,263
You’re scared of writing a letter.
Scared of talking on the phone.

554
00:53:40,412 --> 00:53:42,565
You’re scared of meeting her. What’s the problem?

555
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:43,194
Srinu.

556
00:53:44,605 --> 00:53:47,436
I don’t need to answer every question of you, Srinu.

557
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:50,147
Be in your limits.

558
00:53:53,795 --> 00:53:55,115
Kirthi... -Sir.
let’s go.

559
00:54:00,928 --> 00:54:02,143
Kirthi.. -Yes, sir

560
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:06,319
Change my phone number.
Henceforth  I don’t want Priya’s letters to reach me.

561
00:54:15,261 --> 00:54:17,225
You learnt a good lesson yesterday.

562
00:54:18,108 --> 00:54:19,838
Now you know how to behave with him.

563
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:21,803
Don’t annoy me. -What?

564
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:25,813
I said it. I’m gonna be in my limits.

565
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:28,405
That’s exactly why don’t do things he doesn’t like.

566
00:54:28,445 --> 00:54:29,445
Oh...!

567
00:54:29,693 --> 00:54:31,201
He doesn't like?

568
00:54:31,741 --> 00:54:34,420
Is that why he gets you to read that girl’s letters?

569
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:40,819
He refused to talk on the phone initially
and then spoke for hours in joy.

570
00:54:41,565 --> 00:54:43,248
That’s exactly why we encouraged him to meet her.

571
00:54:43,797 --> 00:54:45,194
He didn’t meet her and blamed us.

572
00:54:46,293 --> 00:54:48,615
These rich guys are beyond my understanding.

573
00:54:50,605 --> 00:54:51,155
Tell me.

574
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,061
What?

575
00:54:55,413 --> 00:54:55,873
Did you see?

576
00:54:58,445 --> 00:54:59,061
Where are you?

577
00:55:00,205 --> 00:55:00,670
I'm coming.

578
00:55:02,428 --> 00:55:04,287
What happened? -I’ll see you in an hour.

579
00:55:05,418 --> 00:55:06,209
Please inform him.

580
00:55:15,738 --> 00:55:18,287
You would have missed the ceremony
if you got any late. -Who is he?

581
00:55:18,934 --> 00:55:20,787
Look at the guy behind the guy in brown.
He’s the groom.

582
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:34,063
Who are you? What are you doing?

583
00:55:34,088 --> 00:55:34,897
What are you doing?

584
00:55:35,516 --> 00:55:37,516
Who are you? -Take your hand off him.

585
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:43,084
Who are you?

586
00:55:45,857 --> 00:55:47,108
Who are you to question him?

587
00:55:47,574 --> 00:55:49,670
You wanna know who he is. Listen to it from me..

588
00:55:50,109 --> 00:55:52,709
He’ll be my husband in 10 minutes.

589
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:55,045
Mother has big dreams about your wedding.

590
00:55:55,326 --> 00:55:57,038
She wont be able to take this.

591
00:55:57,109 --> 00:55:58,186
What do you want me to do now?

592
00:55:58,827 --> 00:56:01,115
What do I do? We pleaded his father.

593
00:56:01,574 --> 00:56:04,201
They enquired about our family. What do I tell them?

594
00:56:04,685 --> 00:56:10,125
That I have a brother who just got out of the prison?
Or about my rogue younger brother?

595
00:56:11,741 --> 00:56:15,108
Who would accept a girl from such a family.

596
00:56:16,534 --> 00:56:20,990
Will his mother accept me?
Should I ruin my life because of you guys?

597
00:56:23,324 --> 00:56:25,686
Will you go talk his father?

598
00:56:26,213 --> 00:56:27,725
Will you get an approval?

599
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:32,826
Look who’s talking!

600
00:56:34,151 --> 00:56:35,014
Sorry!

601
00:56:40,502 --> 00:56:41,303
I will talk!

602
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:47,230
You will talk? What will you talk?

603
00:56:47,653 --> 00:56:49,253
What will you talk?

604
00:56:49,397 --> 00:56:52,757
Swathi, he wants to give it a try.
Let him try.

605
00:56:54,053 --> 00:56:56,006
We’ve waited for so long. We’ll wait for some more time.

606
00:57:04,732 --> 00:57:08,971
Hey, you’re here to talk about your sister.
Be careful.

607
00:57:09,036 --> 00:57:09,996
( Dog barking )

608
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:15,206
Hello, sir.

609
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:19,171
He’s our guy. -My sister...

610
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:20,495
Swathi..

611
00:57:21,018 --> 00:57:23,588
Your son... -So, you’re the brother.

612
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:24,387
Yes sir.

613
00:57:24,755 --> 00:57:27,035
Was wondering why the dog was barking so much.

614
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:29,979
You went to the jail I believe.

615
00:57:31,355 --> 00:57:32,339
What does your mother do?

616
00:57:34,353 --> 00:57:35,729
Railways... -Ah?

617
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:37,182
She’s a clerk.

618
00:57:37,709 --> 00:57:39,823
Oh.. Security! -Sir.

619
00:57:40,754 --> 00:57:41,128
Sir.

620
00:57:41,533 --> 00:57:43,213
What’s your salary?
-Rs. 12,000 sir.

621
00:57:43,595 --> 00:57:43,854
Go..

622
00:57:44,155 --> 00:57:46,395
What’s your mother’s salary? 7000 or 8000?

623
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:49,964
That was a good move.

624
00:57:50,235 --> 00:57:54,275
To find one from such a family and depend on him.

625
00:57:55,948 --> 00:57:56,979
Whose plan was it?

626
00:57:57,435 --> 00:58:00,355
Your mother’s or yours?

627
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,706
You want to hit me?

628
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,714
You are on parole I heard.

629
00:58:11,066 --> 00:58:14,612
One call and you’ll be back in the prison.

630
00:58:18,914 --> 00:58:24,514
Look, My dog also doesn’t like your presence.
How did you expect that I’ll accept your sister.

631
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:27,698
Go away. -Let’s go.

632
00:58:29,374 --> 00:58:31,870
Sir, I’ve a small suggestion. -What?

633
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:35,381
The board outside reads beware of dog.

634
00:58:35,562 --> 00:58:37,522
Add the ‘S’ let it say beware of dogs.

635
00:58:37,588 --> 00:58:40,028
Hey, sit down.

636
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:41,839
Your pants are falling off.

637
00:58:51,451 --> 00:58:52,159
Srinu.

638
00:58:53,508 --> 00:58:54,573
Srinu.. -Yes?

639
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,987
What happened? -Nothing, brother.

640
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,737
Srinu, tell me what happened.

641
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:05,424
One must be born rich. Not like us.

642
00:59:05,853 --> 00:59:06,784
We can’t do anything.

643
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:09,979
Love and relationships is only for the rich.

644
00:59:10,387 --> 00:59:11,518
Not for us.

645
00:59:13,204 --> 00:59:16,073
I stopped my sister’s wedding
because I'm scared for my mother.

646
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:19,549
I went to talk to him.

647
00:59:20,684 --> 00:59:23,964
I couldn’t stop him
when he said things against my mother.

648
00:59:26,651 --> 00:59:30,042
My mother would be very upset
if my sister married without her knowledge.

649
00:59:34,649 --> 00:59:36,956
Now I know who I am.

650
00:59:51,198 --> 00:59:52,432
Excuse me. -Sir?

651
00:59:52,876 --> 00:59:53,807
I need to meet Mr. Kaalidaas.

652
00:59:54,042 --> 00:59:55,456
I don’t care what you do. -Ok sir.

653
00:59:56,024 --> 00:59:57,776
Sir Prasad Rao..

654
00:59:58,307 --> 01:00:01,453
I’d have been there on order.
-I need to talk to you for 5 minutes.

655
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,096
Please come.

656
01:00:03,002 --> 01:00:05,167
Vikram has a message for you. -Tell me, sir.

657
01:00:16,532 --> 01:00:17,393
Now, you must take a call.

658
01:00:21,388 --> 01:00:25,548
I need an hour from Mr. Vikramaditya. Please sir.

659
01:00:47,515 --> 01:00:48,253
Greetings, sister.

660
01:00:50,986 --> 01:00:51,815
May I come in?

661
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,700
My name is Kaalidas. I’m a small time entrepreneur.

662
01:01:04,147 --> 01:01:07,707
I’ll come straight to the point.
My son likes your daughter.

663
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:14,065
He wanted to marry her but the girl wanted your approval.

664
01:01:17,763 --> 01:01:21,026
Now, I like your girl a lot.
Now that’s called moral upbringing.

665
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:28,510
We can make money any time.
But good character is what a person is born with.

666
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:29,932
You just give a nod.

667
01:01:30,885 --> 01:01:35,385
I know it is important to consider their wish…
But our status doesn’t match yours…

668
01:01:35,479 --> 01:01:38,148
What’s the big deal about status?
Every Tom, Dick and Harry has money these days.

669
01:01:38,252 --> 01:01:41,548
We shouldn’t think about these things.

670
01:01:41,674 --> 01:01:44,813
The girl and boy like each other. That’s all matters.

671
01:01:45,067 --> 01:01:47,003
Your daughter is now our daughter.

672
01:01:48,763 --> 01:01:51,534
Just give your consent.
I will take care of everything else.

673
01:01:52,044 --> 01:01:52,799
Is that a ‘yes’ from you?

674
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:59,993
Okay, sister.  We’ll see you.
Drink some coffee.

675
01:02:00,018 --> 01:02:00,933
Come quickly, Swathi.

676
01:02:00,973 --> 01:02:03,093
I have an important meeting to attend in an hour.

677
01:02:03,484 --> 01:02:05,284
This is like my house.
I can join you for coffee at leisure.

678
01:02:05,836 --> 01:02:07,065
See you again.

679
01:02:07,548 --> 01:02:08,143
Let's go..

680
01:02:09,241 --> 01:02:10,471
Swathi See them off.

681
01:02:18,483 --> 01:02:19,143
Swathi, my child..

682
01:02:19,994 --> 01:02:21,260
Are you happy now? -Yes.

683
01:02:21,653 --> 01:02:24,635
Can you call your brother
right away and tell him that?

684
01:02:27,014 --> 01:02:27,974
See you.

685
01:02:46,591 --> 01:02:47,037
Hello..

686
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:51,201
Swathi..

687
01:02:53,122 --> 01:02:54,326
I am sorry, brother.

688
01:02:57,964 --> 01:02:59,959
I never treated you like my brother.

689
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,584
I’ve never given you the respect due to a brother.

690
01:03:06,563 --> 01:03:11,683
I will never forget what you did for me today.

691
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:15,638
You’ve given me what I wished for.
Thank you, brother.

692
01:03:48,017 --> 01:03:49,467
Okay, go!

693
01:03:56,105 --> 01:03:58,853
You should’ve told me before itself that
you’re a close aide of Mr. Vikramaditya.

694
01:03:58,893 --> 01:04:01,293
I am here because of the subcontract
he sanctioned for me.

695
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:03,548
I spoke a little too much. Please don’t mind.

696
01:04:03,596 --> 01:04:07,756
I spoke to your mother.
Swathi will lead a very happy life. Forget about her.

697
01:04:07,852 --> 01:04:08,464
I’ll see you.

698
01:04:09,811 --> 01:04:11,441
Please don’t take anything to your heart.

699
01:04:25,722 --> 01:04:26,714
What’s all this, bro?

700
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:31,761
If I’m your brother. She’s also my sister.

701
01:04:37,652 --> 01:04:40,605
Just a second. It’s brother calling. What’s up, brother?

702
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:42,948
Swathi, is mother happy?

703
01:04:43,074 --> 01:04:44,111
Listen to her yourself.

704
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:46,908
Yes, I'm happy.. Ok sister.

705
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:50,470
Aunt, Swathi’s marriage has been fixed.

706
01:04:51,212 --> 01:04:52,611
They are very rich family.

707
01:04:54,188 --> 01:04:57,181
You said we’d never get a good match for her.
Look what has happened now.

708
01:04:58,012 --> 01:05:01,635
Can I talk to uncle? Pass on the phone.
He’ll get mad that I didn’t tell him.

709
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:05,541
Uncle, your grand-daughter belongs to a rich family now.

710
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,502
She’s very lucky.

711
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,455
I was so worried about her wedding.

712
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,205
By the blessings of almighty, I’m free of that now, uncle.

713
01:05:14,724 --> 01:05:17,361
You guys must come a couple of days before the wedding.

714
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:21,708
Don’t complain later. Alright then, I’ll talk to you later. Bye.

715
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,213
Heard that?

716
01:05:26,293 --> 01:05:26,814
Yes.

717
01:05:28,573 --> 01:05:31,603
Please don’t let mother know what happened yesterday.

718
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:33,072
Okay, brother.

719
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:56,189
Since my childhood I only saw my mother suffer.

720
01:05:57,513 --> 01:06:00,556
For the first time I can sense happiness from her.

721
01:06:03,258 --> 01:06:04,400
It’s all because of you, brother.

722
01:06:23,164 --> 01:06:24,478
Srinu. -Yeah?

723
01:06:25,099 --> 01:06:27,510
Where are you going?
It’s my sister’s wedding.

724
01:06:28,642 --> 01:06:32,220
I want to make money for the arrangements.
I’ll go make a few paintings.

725
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,733
I must hire another Prasad to sell your paintings?

726
01:07:07,003 --> 01:07:07,928
Shut the door.

727
01:07:09,763 --> 01:07:10,631
Shut the door.

728
01:07:14,339 --> 01:07:16,339
Lock? -I meant that.

729
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:20,530
God’s there!

730
01:07:23,051 --> 01:07:25,967
you must do something for me.

731
01:07:27,498 --> 01:07:30,725
I am not used to it.

732
01:07:31,818 --> 01:07:33,827
But I’ll try doing whatever you say.

733
01:07:34,108 --> 01:07:36,967
But not now, Later in the evening.

734
01:07:37,515 --> 01:07:41,428
I can’t wait until evening. -I can’t wait either.

735
01:07:41,803 --> 01:07:43,170
But we don’t have a choice.

736
01:07:46,345 --> 01:07:48,505
But brother will be there in the evening, right?
-yes, he’ll be there.

737
01:07:48,795 --> 01:07:51,995
He’s the main person, right?
-If he’s main. What am I ?

738
01:07:52,147 --> 01:07:53,907
You’ll be there right next to him, right.

739
01:07:55,858 --> 01:07:58,298
Me and brother together. No way.

740
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:01,168
But you’ll have to cut his cake, right?

741
01:08:02,362 --> 01:08:05,480
Cake? -Hey, Don’t you know that it’s his birthday today?

742
01:08:06,146 --> 01:08:09,986
Birthday? -We’ve planned a surprise
birthday party at a hotel this evening.

743
01:08:10,131 --> 01:08:12,809
You should bring him there without his knowledge.

744
01:08:13,379 --> 01:08:15,145
Please, he must not know.

745
01:08:17,371 --> 01:08:20,853
You wanted to shut the door for this?

746
01:08:21,033 --> 01:08:23,674
Yes, its a surprise. Not one must know.

747
01:08:25,947 --> 01:08:27,715
What were you thinking?

748
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:30,104
A lot of things.

749
01:08:31,268 --> 01:08:34,787
I thought the surprise was for me.

750
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:36,500
Leave!

751
01:08:38,955 --> 01:08:40,875
True that.. -Go look into the arrangements.

752
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,435
There’s no Almighty!

753
01:08:52,747 --> 01:08:54,184
Hey, where are you going?

754
01:08:54,946 --> 01:08:56,386
There’s too much traffic. I’ll take a shortcut.

755
01:08:57,819 --> 01:08:59,371
So, there’s a surprise party?

756
01:09:01,176 --> 01:09:04,590
What are you talking about?
She told you everything?

757
01:09:05,162 --> 01:09:06,246
She just can’t keep a secret.

758
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:12,520
Since 5 years they’ve been thinking
that they surprise me.

759
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:15,723
And I keep acting like I actually am.

760
01:09:16,604 --> 01:09:18,479
Oh, brother!

761
01:09:19,184 --> 01:09:20,504
What’s the surprise?

762
01:09:21,435 --> 01:09:22,917
You will know. Let’s go.

763
01:09:24,448 --> 01:09:28,428
Happy birthday! Surprise.

764
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:30,323
Prasad! What a surprise.

765
01:09:31,598 --> 01:09:35,468
Srinu, even you are surprised, right?
-Beyond words.

766
01:09:35,493 --> 01:09:39,013
You’ve seen nothing. The surprise is still there.
-What’s it, sir?

767
01:09:49,274 --> 01:09:50,715
Amazing! Amazing!

768
01:09:58,496 --> 01:09:59,629
Brother. -Uh?

769
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:01,691
You’ve been celebrating your birthday like this for 5 years?

770
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,145
Whose idea is this? -It’s my idea.

771
01:10:06,195 --> 01:10:06,910
Expected.

772
01:10:08,613 --> 01:10:12,676
What did you expect?
As a human one must have love towards art.

773
01:10:13,188 --> 01:10:15,332
What would you have done? -Sir?

774
01:10:15,613 --> 01:10:16,590
Silence.

775
01:10:17,635 --> 01:10:20,675
It’s okay to silent while praying. But a party?

776
01:10:34,259 --> 01:10:35,465
Lakshmi, wake up!

777
01:10:39,788 --> 01:10:42,637
oh, no! -Turn on the lights!

778
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:46,520
hey, lights on! -hello, there’s no echo!
You go ahead!

779
01:10:47,133 --> 01:10:50,013
one... one... -Who is that?

780
01:10:50,082 --> 01:10:52,093
2... 2... 2... -Who are you? Come down, I say!

781
01:10:52,141 --> 01:10:59,021
Hey sisters... this guys is being troublesome.
Please spare time with him.

782
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,333
ey ey..!

783
01:11:01,035 --> 01:11:04,013
One who’d set the twin cities on fire...

784
01:11:04,168 --> 01:11:07,801
Here’s presenting the dancing peacock! -Steady!

785
01:11:07,878 --> 01:11:12,043
Oops! Not a peacock! -Oh!

786
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:19,618
Watch all the fun here. Have fun, boy! Music!

787
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:51,653
Do you want to have a drink?

788
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,827
Doctors advised otherwise, Srinu!
-Not again, brother.

789
01:14:55,602 --> 01:14:57,860
Srinu! -Uh?
Thanks!

790
01:14:58,098 --> 01:15:00,423
But why? -You really surprised me.

791
01:15:02,606 --> 01:15:04,290
This is the best birthday I ever had!

792
01:15:04,483 --> 01:15:06,001
Stop it, brother!

793
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:08,876
Srinu! -Ah?

794
01:15:12,242 --> 01:15:13,673
What’s the peacock’s name?

795
01:15:14,493 --> 01:15:15,688
Hahaha.. -Hahaha..

796
01:15:15,892 --> 01:15:18,307
Did anyone hear that? Hahaha..

797
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:35,829
Good night, brother.

798
01:15:38,115 --> 01:15:38,868
Srinu.

799
01:15:40,915 --> 01:15:45,665
You’ll never leave me, right?
-I’ll never go until you ask me to.

800
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:48,196
Good night.

801
01:16:45,002 --> 01:16:46,048
Good morning, brother!

802
01:16:47,744 --> 01:16:49,508
It’s too late already, wake up!

803
01:16:51,706 --> 01:16:53,844
Brother.. brother...

804
01:17:07,739 --> 01:17:11,099
Brother.. brother...

805
01:17:11,653 --> 01:17:15,373
Brother.. brother...

806
01:17:16,813 --> 01:17:18,733
Brother!

807
01:18:47,993 --> 01:18:49,015
It’s nothing but stress.

808
01:18:49,698 --> 01:18:52,788
When we are stressed, we have number of things to do.

809
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:55,952
we go for a walk or jog...

810
01:18:56,588 --> 01:18:59,358
But it’s very tough for him
considering his physical condition.

811
01:19:00,405 --> 01:19:03,030
His body can’t take it, when he’s stressed.

812
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:06,944
If this continues, it’s going be very difficult.

813
01:19:09,096 --> 01:19:11,398
It is tough to make him stress-free.

814
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:16,390
It is a boon if you are able to forget things.
God hasn’t given him that boon.

815
01:19:17,207 --> 01:19:18,882
How is his health now? -He is alright now.

816
01:19:19,515 --> 01:19:22,062
We will observe him for a day
and discharge him tomorrow.

817
01:19:24,913 --> 01:19:27,062
Srinu, Drop me home.

818
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:35,827
That’s a nice house. Is it yours?

819
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,240
No, I stole it from my neighbour. -I thought as much.

820
01:19:40,553 --> 01:19:42,140
You can leave now.

821
01:19:42,896 --> 01:19:43,765
Are you guys Telugu?

822
01:19:44,233 --> 01:19:45,874
I haven’t eaten anything from morning.
This is the first time I am coming home.

823
01:19:46,269 --> 01:19:47,233
Won’t you invite me in and serve me some food?

824
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:48,601
I guessed right.

825
01:19:49,396 --> 01:19:51,569
You are definitely that villain in the tele-serial.

826
01:19:54,808 --> 01:19:55,179
Ok, come in.

827
01:19:58,077 --> 01:19:58,507
Sit down.

828
01:19:58,918 --> 01:20:01,632
How is Vikram? -He is better.

829
01:20:10,328 --> 01:20:14,248
This painting… -It’s a beautiful painting, right?

830
01:20:14,827 --> 01:20:17,663
Vikram bought it for me. 2 Lakhs.

831
01:20:18,783 --> 01:20:20,101
What is the value you see in this painting?

832
01:20:22,391 --> 01:20:24,951
Do you know anything about painting and art?

833
01:20:26,921 --> 01:20:30,179
To understand art and what the artist tries to convey,
you should not decipher it in your head.

834
01:20:30,565 --> 01:20:32,485
But, feel it in your heart.

835
01:20:33,753 --> 01:20:34,944
So what does this artist convey to you?

836
01:20:36,288 --> 01:20:39,929
Red denotes revolution and anger.

837
01:20:41,094 --> 01:20:44,905
Blue denotes the hope within us.

838
01:20:45,997 --> 01:20:47,866
Can you guess
why the artist has left most of it blank?

839
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:50,671
Maybe he ran short of paint.

840
01:20:51,867 --> 01:20:53,867
That white space is the happiness within us.

841
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:58,812
Do you see the specks of orange scattered here and there?

842
01:20:59,033 --> 01:21:00,929
Do you know what that means? -I don’t know.

843
01:21:01,713 --> 01:21:02,273
Love.

844
01:21:03,682 --> 01:21:04,366
Friendship

845
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:06,008
Beautiful.

846
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:07,999
Can’t believe this painting conveys so much.

847
01:21:08,393 --> 01:21:10,546
Must be a great artist…

848
01:21:11,974 --> 01:21:12,796
Thank you.

849
01:21:13,753 --> 01:21:17,433
For what? -For helping me understand its meaning…

850
01:21:17,891 --> 01:21:20,429
It's okay, Beautiful.. Let’s go.

851
01:21:25,786 --> 01:21:27,015
This is imported liquor.

852
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:29,937
No, I am not. -I don’t believe that.

853
01:21:29,962 --> 01:21:31,390
I am not used to having it with ice cubes.

854
01:21:47,788 --> 01:21:48,382
Sir.

855
01:21:49,545 --> 01:21:52,025
you were talking to the doctor
about brother’s stress or something.

856
01:21:52,284 --> 01:21:53,101
What is that, sir?

857
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:57,069
What do you know about Vikram?

858
01:21:57,993 --> 01:22:00,608
He sits where you make him sit.
He eats what you feed.

859
01:22:00,913 --> 01:22:02,673
He sleeps when you make him lie down. That’s all?

860
01:22:03,554 --> 01:22:05,741
He might be confined to a wheelchair now.

861
01:22:06,953 --> 01:22:12,633
But five years back it was different.
We had to zoom on wheels to catch up with him.

862
01:22:20,194 --> 01:22:24,550
You know what’s the first thing
I remember by his mention? Speed!

863
01:22:32,945 --> 01:22:36,839
He loves car races and bike races,
Always up for some adventure.

864
01:22:37,273 --> 01:22:43,511
He never knew what failure was. He always won.
Be it in business or a race, he always won.

865
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,495
That’s his quality.

866
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:50,769
However stressed he maybe,
he always had that smile on his face.

867
01:22:56,634 --> 01:22:57,565
Who is this woman, sir?

868
01:22:58,936 --> 01:23:01,496
Nandini his one and only love.

869
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:03,526
He was in madly love with her..

870
01:23:04,873 --> 01:23:05,862
They were about to get married.

871
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:08,925
What happened?

872
01:23:10,347 --> 01:23:13,354
He went to Europe for a business trip.
As usual, he was para-gliding....

873
01:23:14,353 --> 01:23:15,526
You know what’s para-gliding, right?

874
01:23:16,003 --> 01:23:19,363
You fly in the sky. That’s his favourite adventure.

875
01:23:19,513 --> 01:23:23,193
He fell off from 150 feet height.

876
01:23:23,796 --> 01:23:24,315
That's it.

877
01:23:25,513 --> 01:23:27,034
Both his cervical got damaged

878
01:23:28,073 --> 01:23:30,033
He went numb from his neck down.

879
01:23:30,523 --> 01:23:31,128
Horrible.

880
01:23:33,433 --> 01:23:37,313
When he regained consciousness,
he wasn’t worried about his condition.

881
01:23:38,178 --> 01:23:39,128
He was anxious about Nandhini.

882
01:23:41,362 --> 01:23:45,833
He felt it would be unfair
to get married to her and be a burden.

883
01:23:47,153 --> 01:23:49,913
He made me lie to her that
he wasn’t interested in getting married to her.

884
01:23:51,632 --> 01:23:54,253
He underwent treatment in Europe for six months.

885
01:23:55,144 --> 01:23:56,854
He never tried meeting her again.

886
01:23:58,198 --> 01:24:01,598
He let go of her thinking that it was the best for her.

887
01:24:01,966 --> 01:24:05,806
He constantly thinks about her well being and happiness.

888
01:24:07,517 --> 01:24:14,034
How much ever he tries to forget his past...
it keeps coming back to him like this.

889
01:24:15,357 --> 01:24:18,144
He was so well. Just can’t see him in this condition.

890
01:24:20,361 --> 01:24:21,847
Nothing must happen to him, sir.

891
01:24:23,375 --> 01:24:25,229
God can never keep anyone happy.

892
01:24:25,809 --> 01:24:27,097
He gets his entertainment from people.

893
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:32,050
He keeps troubling people for fun, sir.

894
01:24:33,056 --> 01:24:33,972
He’s a bad boy!

895
01:24:35,384 --> 01:24:38,847
Now I accept that you’re Telugu.

896
01:24:39,721 --> 01:24:41,058
You are very emotional.

897
01:24:42,269 --> 01:24:47,229
You told me so many facts when I asked.
Despite you not asking, I want to tell you one fact, sir.

898
01:24:49,033 --> 01:24:51,273
I would not be at peace otherwise. -What is that?

899
01:24:52,753 --> 01:24:55,993
I painted that.

900
01:25:01,037 --> 01:25:03,677
I never knew my painting had
so much meaning until you told me.

901
01:25:04,865 --> 01:25:08,729
But thanks for understanding and buying it.
I’ll see you, sir!

902
01:25:23,555 --> 01:25:24,515
Good morning.

903
01:25:25,339 --> 01:25:27,479
Vikram, How are you feeling now?

904
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:30,420
Much better. -You’ll be discharged today.

905
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:33,370
There are a couple of medicines
that you have to take for a month.

906
01:25:33,586 --> 01:25:35,546
Who is looking after your medication?

907
01:25:39,827 --> 01:25:40,894
What is this? -Sir.

908
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,720
The body might be taking
the medicines but not the heart.

909
01:25:46,383 --> 01:25:47,823
So many medicines for stress?

910
01:25:48,802 --> 01:25:51,762
Some alcohol at night and all
the stress disappears by morning.

911
01:25:52,954 --> 01:25:55,262
You once told me that you
go to some place when you are stressed.

912
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:56,293
Which place is that?

913
01:25:57,004 --> 01:25:57,804
Paris.

914
01:25:58,859 --> 01:25:59,457
Paris.

915
01:25:59,906 --> 01:26:00,894
Can we go to Paris?

916
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:02,465
Have you gone crazy?

917
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:04,621
How can he go when he is in this condition?

918
01:26:04,787 --> 01:26:07,324
Paris, Are you planning the trip for him
or for yourself?

919
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:08,496
I don’t care what you think.

920
01:26:09,583 --> 01:26:13,983
You would have been to Paris many times.
But this is my only chance. Can I tag along with you?

921
01:26:15,993 --> 01:26:20,121
Ok, I’ve missed seeing a lot of things in my life.
I will add one more to my list now.

922
01:26:20,146 --> 01:26:23,666
That’s enough of over-acting!
We can’t take it.

923
01:26:24,361 --> 01:26:24,902
Prasad.

924
01:26:27,971 --> 01:26:30,840
Didn’t you tell me that Srinu is on parole?

925
01:26:31,706 --> 01:26:35,324
Take care of those formalities. We are going to Paris.

926
01:27:03,681 --> 01:27:04,918
How much does a ticket to Paris cost?

927
01:27:05,883 --> 01:27:07,066
This is our plane.

928
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:10,348
You make it sound so normal.

929
01:28:28,972 --> 01:28:30,620
Such a beautiful city, Srinu.

930
01:28:33,913 --> 01:28:36,370
I agree. Very beautiful!

931
01:28:36,643 --> 01:28:39,175
Paris, City of love.

932
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:42,409
Full of love…

933
01:28:44,245 --> 01:28:45,922
Good morning sir. -Good morning.

934
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,113
Why are you so beautiful?

935
01:28:47,418 --> 01:28:47,956
What?

936
01:28:48,226 --> 01:28:51,370
Brother was mentioning that Paris is beautiful. Right?

937
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:52,505
Yes.

938
01:28:54,386 --> 01:28:55,066
Sir..

939
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:57,836
I sat up all night and made the best plan to see Paris.

940
01:28:58,113 --> 01:29:00,948
Ten o’clock is the best town to see. -Eifel Tower!

941
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,277
After that we can go to... -Louvre Museum...

942
01:29:04,837 --> 01:29:06,323
And then we go to the music street.

943
01:29:06,825 --> 01:29:09,159
And finally to the romantic river cruise.

944
01:29:09,229 --> 01:29:10,069
Brother.

945
01:29:11,315 --> 01:29:12,675
Have you worked as a guide here?

946
01:29:14,644 --> 01:29:16,003
I love Paris, Srinu.

947
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:23,253
They’ve built such a huge cell phone tower.

948
01:29:24,162 --> 01:29:25,480
I don’t think they will ever have network issues.

949
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:28,101
That is not a cell phone tower.
That’s Eiffel Tower.

950
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:31,140
Oh! They give a name even for cell phone towers.

951
01:29:33,762 --> 01:29:36,003
It's so beautiful sir.. - It is..

952
01:29:36,299 --> 01:29:37,299
Click a picture.

953
01:30:02,193 --> 01:30:03,535
Idiot. What are you doing?

954
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:07,613
Don’t you want the tower in the background?
Just focus on me. That will do.

955
01:30:07,729 --> 01:30:09,941
If you wanted a picture of only yourself,
you’ve could have got one back home.

956
01:30:10,918 --> 01:30:12,082
What do you say, brother?

957
01:30:12,346 --> 01:30:15,306
Only if the tower’s in the picture will
she get lots of likes on facebook, right?

958
01:30:15,635 --> 01:30:16,129
That’s true.

959
01:30:16,447 --> 01:30:17,441
Some people will never understand.

960
01:30:59,932 --> 01:31:01,855
Srinu, let’s go!

961
01:31:11,547 --> 01:31:13,147
One painting costs 50 Lakhs?

962
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:16,391
You might not get one for even 50 Crores.

963
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:19,148
I must start painting here.

964
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:22,844
Srinu, let’s go!

965
01:31:25,609 --> 01:31:28,102
This is amazing. Let’s take a picture here.

966
01:31:28,436 --> 01:31:29,719
Give it to me. -Hey, that’s my phone.

967
01:31:31,275 --> 01:31:32,078
Brother, smile please.

968
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:33,562
Brother.

969
01:31:48,633 --> 01:31:49,750
Kirthi... -Yes sir.

970
01:31:50,433 --> 01:31:51,961
We are leaving tomorrow. -What, brother?

971
01:31:54,401 --> 01:31:55,578
We are going back to India tomorrow.

972
01:31:55,953 --> 01:31:56,734
What happened, brother?

973
01:31:57,513 --> 01:32:01,516
You love Paris..
And now you want to go back?

974
01:32:04,363 --> 01:32:05,719
I don’t like myself, Srinu.

975
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:09,727
For the first time I am missing myself.

976
01:32:12,825 --> 01:32:15,359
When you said Paris, I was very excited.

977
01:32:16,418 --> 01:32:17,836
I thought I’ll find myself.

978
01:32:21,488 --> 01:32:22,945
But I just realised...

979
01:32:25,835 --> 01:32:27,117
That Vikram is no more.

980
01:32:28,258 --> 01:32:29,180
I can never find him again.

981
01:32:31,442 --> 01:32:32,875
But one thing is true.

982
01:32:34,546 --> 01:32:37,906
I realise that the heart doesn’t follow you
wherever you go.

983
01:33:06,264 --> 01:33:07,864
Idiot! Stop the car.

984
01:33:11,303 --> 01:33:13,039
Srinu, Don’t let them go.

985
01:33:17,272 --> 01:33:18,453
Overtake that car.

986
01:33:52,359 --> 01:33:53,562
Change the gear.

987
01:34:06,943 --> 01:34:08,000
You want to play with us?

988
01:34:08,883 --> 01:34:14,078
Lets, go. -Press the brake and then accelerate.

989
01:34:22,548 --> 01:34:25,086
Kirthi, wear your seat belt.

990
01:36:07,263 --> 01:36:07,953
Srinu, Right.

991
01:36:21,331 --> 01:36:22,195
Go, srinu.

992
01:37:18,231 --> 01:37:20,262
Shift the gear and accelerate.

993
01:38:25,063 --> 01:38:27,463
Srinu, let’s go see Paris now.

994
01:40:25,996 --> 01:40:26,685
Wow!

995
01:40:56,784 --> 01:41:00,567
5 years ago... I met with an accident right here.

996
01:41:04,653 --> 01:41:08,332
In just a second my life became a memory.

997
01:41:11,591 --> 01:41:13,431
Why remember all that now, brother. Let’s go!

998
01:41:17,366 --> 01:41:18,934
Srinu.. -Brother.

999
01:41:19,398 --> 01:41:20,285
I want to fly!

1000
01:41:21,845 --> 01:41:22,473
What?

1001
01:41:24,948 --> 01:41:25,918
I want to fly!

1002
01:41:28,893 --> 01:41:30,621
Don't worry, I am doing good.

1003
01:41:31,782 --> 01:41:33,582
This is madness. What are you doing..?

1004
01:41:33,763 --> 01:41:36,903
You should have denied, right?
-Let him do whatever he wants to do.

1005
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:39,770
What is it?

1006
01:41:41,383 --> 01:41:44,183
No No.. Hey, leave me!

1007
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:47,285
no no .. brother!

1008
01:41:47,504 --> 01:41:49,168
Even though your limbs don’t function..
everyone is looking at you.

1009
01:41:49,327 --> 01:41:51,449
I am perfectly alright. No one is looking at me.
No, brother. No!

1010
01:41:52,254 --> 01:41:54,660
You can tell him, right? Go, tell him!

1011
01:41:55,384 --> 01:41:57,559
Let him do whatever he wants to do.

1012
01:41:59,344 --> 01:42:02,278
That’s how you’re giving back to me? Tell him!

1013
01:42:21,654 --> 01:42:24,528
Hey.. No.. I'm a virgin, there is a lot see..

1014
01:42:34,783 --> 01:42:38,223
Hey.. I'll get heart attack please leave me.

1015
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:49,512
Looks like he’s having fun!

1016
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:02,293
What’s that sound? What’s with the fear?

1017
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,410
Don’t laugh loud, brother. Kirthi can hear you.

1018
01:43:06,012 --> 01:43:09,707
I was very strong until now. It’s all over now, brother.

1019
01:43:09,935 --> 01:43:13,495
You were trying to impress her for three months.
Did she ever look at you?

1020
01:43:13,783 --> 01:43:16,823
No, brother. I never took it seriously.

1021
01:43:16,913 --> 01:43:18,638
Are you scared of taking it seriously?

1022
01:43:18,678 --> 01:43:20,118
Scared about what? -Then, go tell her.

1023
01:43:20,496 --> 01:43:21,536
I will...

1024
01:43:23,103 --> 01:43:24,131
I’ll propose to her with a flower.

1025
01:43:37,705 --> 01:43:38,764
Ki.. Kirthi..

1026
01:43:40,168 --> 01:43:40,709
What?

1027
01:43:42,063 --> 01:43:43,670
What’s with the flower?

1028
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:48,920
The flower dried up. Thought I’ll change.

1029
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:53,412
Are you working?

1030
01:43:54,334 --> 01:43:56,506
Nope. I’m sleeping. -Okay, sleep well.

1031
01:44:02,924 --> 01:44:06,124
I was so confident when I went.

1032
01:44:06,943 --> 01:44:10,623
But my heart started beating
so fast when I went closer.

1033
01:44:10,751 --> 01:44:12,671
That’s called fear, Srinu.

1034
01:44:13,406 --> 01:44:15,342
Where there’s love, there’s fear.

1035
01:44:16,863 --> 01:44:19,975
Fear of rejection.

1036
01:44:21,559 --> 01:44:24,154
Fear of loss after acceptance.

1037
01:44:26,345 --> 01:44:31,107
Fear of moving apart.

1038
01:44:34,678 --> 01:44:36,709
Truly, where there’s fear, there’s love.

1039
01:44:38,087 --> 01:44:41,732
Your thought is so profound.

1040
01:44:43,063 --> 01:44:44,810
Once upon a time you were a romantic, right?

1041
01:44:45,414 --> 01:44:46,732
Even now!

1042
01:44:49,621 --> 01:44:53,576
Even now? You’re drunk. Let’s go!

1043
01:44:54,823 --> 01:44:56,779
You won't believe me? -Nope.

1044
01:44:57,983 --> 01:44:58,842
Try me!

1045
01:45:01,063 --> 01:45:04,903
Pick up a girl. I’ll make her fall for me in two days.

1046
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:06,889
Pick one.

1047
01:45:23,623 --> 01:45:24,467
What’s the bet?

1048
01:45:26,405 --> 01:45:29,285
What if she falls for me in two days? What’s the bet?

1049
01:45:30,646 --> 01:45:31,637
You decide!

1050
01:45:31,865 --> 01:45:35,585
If she falls for me in two days..
you must disclose your feelings to kirthi.

1051
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:39,880
If she falls for you. Done. Let’s see.

1052
01:46:27,692 --> 01:46:30,028
Brother! he’s here.
Where do I send him again?

1053
01:46:31,252 --> 01:46:33,363
Give him some money and ask him to leave.

1054
01:46:36,141 --> 01:46:41,090
Thanks for the bike, brother. We are now done.
How do I tell that in his language?

1055
01:46:43,823 --> 01:46:46,706
Je t’aime.  Serre moi. Embrazze moi!

1056
01:46:50,325 --> 01:46:53,776
You think I cant say it?
I will do it, wait and see.

1057
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:58,518
He’ll just say it. -Let him.

1058
01:46:58,908 --> 01:47:02,073
Je t’aime.  Serre moi. Embrazze moi!

1059
01:47:08,073 --> 01:47:09,378
Why are you holding my hand?

1060
01:47:10,489 --> 01:47:13,081
Your work is done. Leave.
Why are you falling on me?

1061
01:47:14,768 --> 01:47:16,839
I’m not that kind of a guy.

1062
01:47:19,546 --> 01:47:20,527
Don't allow him.

1063
01:47:24,411 --> 01:47:26,894
Why is he falling on me
when I asked him to leave?

1064
01:47:27,973 --> 01:47:31,667
You said.. you loved him and asked him to hug and kiss.

1065
01:47:31,966 --> 01:47:32,839
Me?

1066
01:47:36,577 --> 01:47:38,177
What’s this, brother?

1067
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:43,410
Go away!

1068
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:51,449
Will she come, brother?

1069
01:47:52,197 --> 01:47:53,285
For sure..

1070
01:47:54,214 --> 01:47:56,769
Will girls come on sending that flower?
You are too much!

1071
01:47:57,113 --> 01:47:58,743
I didn’t send her flowers.

1072
01:47:58,853 --> 01:48:00,613
Curiosity. - what?

1073
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:03,340
Curiosity.

1074
01:48:04,766 --> 01:48:05,714
I don’t believe it.

1075
01:48:14,002 --> 01:48:14,964
She’s here.

1076
01:48:16,349 --> 01:48:18,792
Curiosity is here. -Why are you still here? Leave!

1077
01:48:26,144 --> 01:48:28,535
You knew she was coming?
You are waiting at the right place.

1078
01:48:32,743 --> 01:48:33,253
Jenny.

1079
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:35,847
You're looking for me?

1080
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:38,496
Vikram! -Ya it's me.

1081
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:49,640
Is it you who sent me the flowers? -Yeah.

1082
01:48:50,013 --> 01:48:50,853
But why?

1083
01:48:51,103 --> 01:48:53,423
Beauty not admired is a sin.

1084
01:48:54,685 --> 01:48:55,535
You’re beautiful.

1085
01:48:56,980 --> 01:48:58,371
Hello, subtitles!

1086
01:48:58,783 --> 01:48:59,410
What?

1087
01:49:00,046 --> 01:49:02,582
What’s the girl saying?
-She asked why he sent the flowers?

1088
01:49:03,028 --> 01:49:05,848
What did brother say?
-Beauty not admired is a sin.

1089
01:49:06,412 --> 01:49:07,660
You’re beautiful.

1090
01:49:08,366 --> 01:49:09,957
This is exactly what I wanted to say.

1091
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:13,183
Why did you send me flowers?

1092
01:49:13,341 --> 01:49:15,035
I want to go out on a date with you.

1093
01:49:15,484 --> 01:49:16,769
A date? -Yeah.

1094
01:49:18,845 --> 01:49:20,894
With you? -Don’t go by the looks.

1095
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:22,809
Looks can be deceiving.

1096
01:49:23,204 --> 01:49:26,084
What if I say no? -Think before you say no.

1097
01:49:26,709 --> 01:49:29,426
You just might miss
one of the most beautiful day in your life.

1098
01:49:34,074 --> 01:49:36,715
It’s amazing. You know what he said...

1099
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:39,699
The girl laughed. She’s fallen for him.
The game is over!

1100
01:50:10,308 --> 01:50:11,637
Hello.. Hello..

1101
01:50:11,848 --> 01:50:13,754
Why do you want to disturb them. Let’s go.

1102
01:50:13,948 --> 01:50:16,268
Why should I interrupt the two of you.

1103
01:50:16,878 --> 01:50:17,816
Two of us?

1104
01:50:25,756 --> 01:50:27,051
I can’t take it anymore.

1105
01:50:33,726 --> 01:50:35,418
Where were you hiding all these days, Jenny?

1106
01:50:37,102 --> 01:50:39,074
Never seen Sir so happy before.

1107
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:43,330
How did you figure out that coming here
would make him so happy?

1108
01:50:45,089 --> 01:50:47,409
I didn’t know. My mother always said...

1109
01:50:47,633 --> 01:50:49,605
You’ll find where you lost.

1110
01:50:51,105 --> 01:50:53,505
He lost it all here. That’s why I got him here.

1111
01:51:00,316 --> 01:51:02,187
Is there a show happening here? -Ya.

1112
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:03,851
It's your show.

1113
01:51:05,232 --> 01:51:06,554
My show? -Yes.

1114
01:51:07,402 --> 01:51:09,655
Perfect day is not over without a dance.

1115
01:51:11,145 --> 01:51:12,210
Will you dance with me?

1116
01:51:14,089 --> 01:51:15,023
Dance with you?

1117
01:51:16,691 --> 01:51:19,296
How is that possible? -Just dance with me.

1118
01:51:20,261 --> 01:51:23,304
Every breath and move you make, I'll be there with you.

1119
01:51:24,789 --> 01:51:26,554
Yes, It's a promise.

1120
01:53:17,355 --> 01:53:18,405
That was magical.

1121
01:53:19,634 --> 01:53:22,999
You're right,
It was one of the most beautiful days of my life.

1122
01:53:25,477 --> 01:53:26,037
Thank you.

1123
01:53:59,431 --> 01:54:00,288
Hmm..

1124
01:54:00,958 --> 01:54:04,518
You are like this today.
How were you before the incident?

1125
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:08,740
How can any girl come like that?
How can she laugh like that?

1126
01:54:08,830 --> 01:54:12,270
How could she dance? The kisses... oh my!

1127
01:54:12,734 --> 01:54:15,494
You think I’ll forget the bet if you divert me?

1128
01:54:16,863 --> 01:54:18,194
What bet are you talking about?

1129
01:54:18,526 --> 01:54:20,015
You must go and talk to Kirthi.

1130
01:54:20,398 --> 01:54:21,827
It’s late. Sleep now. Good night!

1131
01:54:22,158 --> 01:54:23,318
You are not standing by your words.

1132
01:54:25,179 --> 01:54:26,663
I can’t talk like you, brother.

1133
01:54:26,806 --> 01:54:29,126
You must have thought about it
before accepting the challenge.

1134
01:54:30,343 --> 01:54:31,046
Srinu..

1135
01:54:31,855 --> 01:54:33,718
Just say whatever you have in your heart.

1136
01:54:35,383 --> 01:54:35,952
Go.

1137
01:54:37,779 --> 01:54:38,851
I’m going only because of you.

1138
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:41,843
Srinu..

1139
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:44,882
You are forgetting the flower.

1140
01:54:58,441 --> 01:54:58,999
Kirthi..

1141
01:55:00,148 --> 01:55:01,351
I need to talk to you...

1142
01:55:02,502 --> 01:55:03,718
Don’t turn around.

1143
01:55:04,223 --> 01:55:05,710
I might not be able to talk then.

1144
01:55:09,248 --> 01:55:10,312
I’ll tell you a truth.

1145
01:55:11,492 --> 01:55:13,210
I’m really scared of you.

1146
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:19,360
Because I can’t match up to you...

1147
01:55:20,004 --> 01:55:22,124
Don’t think about our compatibility.

1148
01:55:22,739 --> 01:55:26,163
Meenakshi and I complemented each other,
but that didn’t work out.. right?

1149
01:55:26,623 --> 01:55:29,601
That means we can work out.

1150
01:55:30,551 --> 01:55:35,444
But Meenakshi is not as great as you. You are hot!

1151
01:55:39,622 --> 01:55:40,108
See..

1152
01:55:41,263 --> 01:55:43,280
I feared talking like this.

1153
01:55:44,744 --> 01:55:48,671
But brother said where there’s fear, there’s love.

1154
01:55:51,871 --> 01:55:52,788
I am saying it...

1155
01:55:53,808 --> 01:55:54,663
I am saying it...

1156
01:55:57,690 --> 01:55:58,194
I

1157
01:56:00,769 --> 01:56:01,390
Love

1158
01:56:03,328 --> 01:56:03,655
You.

1159
01:56:11,495 --> 01:56:12,101
Hey!

1160
01:56:13,317 --> 01:56:14,491
you didn’t scold me.

1161
01:56:15,848 --> 01:56:16,874
Is that a yes?

1162
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:36,294
Srinu..

1163
01:56:46,447 --> 01:56:48,731
Are you blind?

1164
01:56:49,416 --> 01:56:51,496
Just because there is a girl in front of you,
will you not see the glass?

1165
01:56:52,034 --> 01:56:54,474
What an embarrassment?
How will you go back to India?

1166
01:57:04,623 --> 01:57:06,005
He is a pain.

1167
01:57:08,091 --> 01:57:08,895
Hey, Where are you?

1168
01:57:09,152 --> 01:57:10,208
Come out..

1169
01:57:10,757 --> 01:57:12,450
I’ve come to visit your country
and you give me flowers.

1170
01:57:13,896 --> 01:57:15,262
Flowers! who sent?
where is he?

1171
01:57:16,443 --> 01:57:19,794
Excuse me..  I am sorry.
I am sorry. You can go!

1172
01:57:21,353 --> 01:57:22,153
Why are you screaming?

1173
01:57:22,303 --> 01:57:24,341
Despite warning him, he sent me flowers.

1174
01:57:26,107 --> 01:57:27,707
Are you sure he sent you the flowers? -Then?

1175
01:57:28,047 --> 01:57:29,567
Who else will send flowers to me?

1176
01:57:29,723 --> 01:57:31,028
look at the flowers closely.

1177
01:57:43,427 --> 01:57:44,872
I wanted to give you the flower..

1178
01:57:48,352 --> 01:57:51,169
Then who kept the flowers? -I kept it there.

1179
01:57:52,602 --> 01:57:53,364
Does that mean you heard me?

1180
01:57:54,482 --> 01:57:55,169
Don’t ask me

1181
01:57:56,306 --> 01:57:59,270
I don’t know how I liked you.

1182
01:58:00,371 --> 01:58:04,864
But I know the one you love will remain happy forever.

1183
01:58:05,891 --> 01:58:07,528
I can see that in sir.

1184
01:58:08,998 --> 01:58:11,622
I need that. That’s why I like you.

1185
01:58:16,593 --> 01:58:17,184
Hey, wait!

1186
01:58:18,552 --> 01:58:22,184
Are you informing me or confirming it to me?

1187
01:58:26,623 --> 01:58:28,794
Hey. That smile!

1188
02:02:02,831 --> 02:02:04,214
Brother.. I'll be right back..

1189
02:02:10,657 --> 02:02:11,761
Brother! -Yeah?

1190
02:02:26,015 --> 02:02:26,519
Srinu!

1191
02:02:31,031 --> 02:02:31,534
Srinu!

1192
02:02:33,628 --> 02:02:34,238
Srinu come..

1193
02:02:54,856 --> 02:02:55,761
Srinu.

1194
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:15,331
Vikram.

1195
02:03:24,951 --> 02:03:26,464
Are you running away from me?

1196
02:04:49,743 --> 02:04:53,343
When you left me, I didn’t suspect anything.

1197
02:04:54,326 --> 02:04:55,966
I believed we were in love.

1198
02:04:56,742 --> 02:04:59,022
That moment you went away is still fresh in mind.

1199
02:05:01,062 --> 02:05:06,582
I thought I should never see you
or think of you again.

1200
02:05:08,139 --> 02:05:09,722
But when I continued thinking of you..

1201
02:05:10,591 --> 02:05:14,730
I was angry with myself for falling in love
with a man like you.

1202
02:05:15,214 --> 02:05:18,238
I began to hate you. But a week back..

1203
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:23,159
Srinu called me to tell me everything.

1204
02:05:37,183 --> 02:05:42,511
I wondered how I stayed happy despite
of having so much hatred in me

1205
02:05:45,497 --> 02:05:47,175
It was only after I spoke to Srinu

1206
02:05:49,133 --> 02:05:56,136
Your good wishes for me were way stronger
than my hatred towards you.

1207
02:05:58,118 --> 02:06:01,683
How, Vikram? How can you love someone so much?

1208
02:06:02,837 --> 02:06:06,397
These five years, You lost yourself for me.

1209
02:06:07,813 --> 02:06:09,988
You were worried about me, right?

1210
02:06:12,463 --> 02:06:15,722
You kept away from me because
you wanted us to be happy, right?

1211
02:06:17,853 --> 02:06:20,018
And you are leaving without seeing that happiness?

1212
02:06:36,550 --> 02:06:37,788
That’s my daughter Aadhya

1213
02:06:40,031 --> 02:06:41,382
And my husband Abhinav.

1214
02:06:45,387 --> 02:06:48,296
This is my family. My happiness.

1215
02:08:12,147 --> 02:08:14,264
Thanks, Vikram. Thanks for meeting me.

1216
02:08:14,769 --> 02:08:18,077
I’d have hated you for life hadn’t you met me.

1217
02:08:18,723 --> 02:08:24,003
You hope to love me and not have me.

1218
02:08:24,506 --> 02:08:31,796
As much as you want me to be happy,
I want you to be happier than that.

1219
02:08:32,209 --> 02:08:33,741
Hope you make my wish come true.

1220
02:08:55,176 --> 02:08:58,994
How are you? I have a scent bottle for you.
-Hi, vikram.

1221
02:08:59,523 --> 02:09:01,763
How are you, old man?
-Who is the old man?

1222
02:09:02,898 --> 02:09:04,955
I saw an excellent painting for you in Paris.

1223
02:09:07,489 --> 02:09:10,205
Of all the things you found
a painting for me in Paris?

1224
02:09:12,123 --> 02:09:13,323
Lakshmi. -Sir?

1225
02:09:13,536 --> 02:09:16,080
I’m tired of all the salads I had in the last 10 days.

1226
02:09:16,945 --> 02:09:18,705
Make me some yummy stew.

1227
02:09:22,009 --> 02:09:24,289
Just a second, sir.
Give me that plate...

1228
02:09:24,458 --> 02:09:27,627
Where did I keep the plate?
Not this one, give me a bowl for stew.

1229
02:09:27,745 --> 02:09:29,665
You washed it properly, right?

1230
02:09:30,132 --> 02:09:32,692
Give me some pepper and some coriander powder..
-Lakshmi.

1231
02:09:33,386 --> 02:09:34,580
Why are you in such a hurry?

1232
02:09:34,697 --> 02:09:38,377
It’s been 5 years.
He asked me something for the first time.

1233
02:09:38,563 --> 02:09:40,803
I don’t have time for this. I need to serve him stew.

1234
02:09:40,803 --> 02:09:42,463
Get me some tamarind.

1235
02:09:44,979 --> 02:09:47,947
Looks like you had a great holiday. -I met Nandini.

1236
02:10:06,946 --> 02:10:07,893
Srinu.

1237
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:12,112
Hi Sir, how have you been?

1238
02:10:12,563 --> 02:10:16,443
I asked him that day...
why did you choose him?

1239
02:10:17,852 --> 02:10:21,212
He said,
you were the right choice that moment.

1240
02:10:22,249 --> 02:10:23,885
I felt he was doing wrong.

1241
02:10:25,721 --> 02:10:26,729
But it’s my mistake.

1242
02:10:27,993 --> 02:10:31,393
I  saw him in this condition for
5 years and did nothing.

1243
02:10:32,163 --> 02:10:34,163
I told you about him for 5 minutes...

1244
02:10:35,144 --> 02:10:36,619
And you changed his life.

1245
02:10:38,465 --> 02:10:38,971
Thank you.

1246
02:10:40,643 --> 02:10:42,003
You’d never leave him, right?

1247
02:10:42,243 --> 02:10:45,237
Why would I leave a bathroom
and bedroom like this, sir.

1248
02:10:46,305 --> 02:10:47,760
Where would I go anyway.

1249
02:10:50,008 --> 02:10:51,744
I have a small doubt. -What’s that, sir?

1250
02:10:53,458 --> 02:10:54,213
Painting..

1251
02:10:56,036 --> 02:10:57,996
Did you really paint that? -You’re too much.

1252
02:10:58,139 --> 02:11:01,179
I trusted you and started another painting as well.
-Spare me, dude!

1253
02:11:01,527 --> 02:11:03,607
Sir! -Thank you very much.

1254
02:11:05,947 --> 02:11:08,822
Prasad knew that you painted that?
I told him, brother.

1255
02:11:08,847 --> 02:11:11,127
Srinu, Someone is here for you.

1256
02:11:11,594 --> 02:11:12,401
For me?

1257
02:11:34,957 --> 02:11:37,469
Who told you that I was here?

1258
02:11:38,761 --> 02:11:39,594
Sister told me.

1259
02:11:47,539 --> 02:11:52,063
Hey open your mouth, where’s your son?

1260
02:11:53,610 --> 02:11:56,490
He has been booked under attempt to murder case.

1261
02:12:03,516 --> 02:12:06,539
Your son got drunk with his friends
and got into a fight at the bar.

1262
02:12:06,845 --> 02:12:09,605
Two of them are in the hospital.
They are fighting for their life.

1263
02:12:09,994 --> 02:12:11,954
We know that you know where he is.

1264
02:12:12,368 --> 02:12:14,055
He better surrender himself by morning.

1265
02:12:14,414 --> 02:12:17,258
But if we find him, you know what’s gonna happen.

1266
02:12:22,032 --> 02:12:22,750
What did you do?

1267
02:12:24,425 --> 02:12:25,328
Tell me what happened?

1268
02:12:26,074 --> 02:12:27,609
I didn’t do anything.

1269
02:12:28,585 --> 02:12:29,719
They were having a fight.

1270
02:12:30,371 --> 02:12:33,411
I was just there. I didn’t hit anyone.

1271
02:12:39,109 --> 02:12:40,524
Okay, sit here.

1272
02:12:52,850 --> 02:12:53,602
Just a minute, brother.

1273
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:57,000
Swathi? – Brother..

1274
02:12:57,136 --> 02:12:58,766
He’s with me. I’ll look after this.

1275
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:01,031
You take care of mother.

1276
02:13:03,909 --> 02:13:06,836
This is exactly what I was worried the most about.

1277
02:13:08,442 --> 02:13:11,547
I lost one son already.. and now the other.

1278
02:13:12,924 --> 02:13:14,641
What have I done? -Mother.

1279
02:13:22,289 --> 02:13:23,711
Srinu! -What is it about?

1280
02:13:23,981 --> 02:13:25,945
You remembered us after a long time.

1281
02:13:26,804 --> 02:13:29,884
Kanna is in some problem. Take him to your village

1282
02:13:30,929 --> 02:13:33,953
He better not be seen in the city for at least 2 weeks.
-you’re coming, right?

1283
02:13:34,124 --> 02:13:35,734
You know I can’t go.

1284
02:13:37,081 --> 02:13:39,008
You come quickly. -Okay. Hey, bring the vehicle!

1285
02:13:42,492 --> 02:13:44,508
Do you want to sleep, brother?
-What happened, srinu?

1286
02:13:44,587 --> 02:13:46,667
Nothing much, brother. Just a small issue.
-Is he your brother?

1287
02:13:48,854 --> 02:13:50,934
Why bother about all that now?
Let’s hit the bed.

1288
02:13:51,691 --> 02:13:54,731
When you called me brother,
I thought you meant it.

1289
02:13:56,026 --> 02:14:00,203
But you hide a lot of things from me.
I don’t know.

1290
02:14:01,354 --> 02:14:01,977
Ok.

1291
02:14:07,366 --> 02:14:08,297
He is not my brother.

1292
02:14:11,419 --> 02:14:12,719
He is not my own brother.

1293
02:14:19,699 --> 02:14:23,500
Even the person I call my mother
is not the one who gave birth to me.

1294
02:14:33,708 --> 02:14:36,680
She is my mother’s sister.

1295
02:14:38,133 --> 02:14:41,093
When I was seven years old,
my parents died in an accident.

1296
02:14:42,525 --> 02:14:48,445
When everyone wanted to send me to an orphanage,
my aunt said she would raise me.

1297
02:14:49,653 --> 02:14:51,570
My sister and brother were born later.

1298
02:14:52,586 --> 02:14:57,219
After my uncle died,
my mother had a tough time raising all of us.

1299
02:14:57,782 --> 02:15:02,302
When I saw her struggling,
I would think I was an added burden to her.

1300
02:15:03,756 --> 02:15:04,930
I thought I would ease her troubles
by not going to school.

1301
02:15:05,468 --> 02:15:07,781
When she questioned me I didn’t say anything.

1302
02:15:09,036 --> 02:15:11,996
Ever since, we quarrelled a lot.

1303
02:15:12,383 --> 02:15:14,172
I wanted to do a lot for her...

1304
02:15:14,641 --> 02:15:17,211
I wanted to earn a lot of money to give her.

1305
02:15:17,977 --> 02:15:19,711
But I didn’t know how to earn it.

1306
02:15:20,833 --> 02:15:23,553
That’s why I started stealing.

1307
02:15:24,125 --> 02:15:25,109
She said me to get out of the house

1308
02:15:25,328 --> 02:15:30,586
I want to make money for her happiness
and not for myself.

1309
02:15:32,203 --> 02:15:33,914
But she never understood me.

1310
02:15:35,761 --> 02:15:37,539
She’s blaming me even now.

1311
02:15:42,939 --> 02:15:48,579
If money brings happiness,
I should be the happiest man in this universe, Srinu.

1312
02:15:51,045 --> 02:15:56,492
I needed a man who was just out of jail
to show me what happiness was.

1313
02:15:58,644 --> 02:16:01,914
Do you know where your happiness lies?

1314
02:16:03,321 --> 02:16:04,125
It’s with your mother.

1315
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:09,352
You want to be close to your mother,
but you are distancing yourself from her.

1316
02:16:11,395 --> 02:16:12,055
Go away, srinu.

1317
02:16:16,293 --> 02:16:18,703
You can’t live alongside a wheelchair all your life, right?

1318
02:16:20,578 --> 02:16:24,125
Your mother needs you more than me.

1319
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:30,625
You gave so much to a complete stranger like me...
imagine what you can do for your mother.

1320
02:16:32,212 --> 02:16:36,750
You must find where you lost, srinu.

1321
02:16:54,156 --> 02:16:56,664
I’ll be there in 5 minutes. Bring kanna outside.

1322
02:16:57,244 --> 02:17:00,500
You leave. I’m going home now.

1323
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:15,992
Sir is calling.. come.

1324
02:18:30,043 --> 02:18:31,929
Take your brother and go home.

1325
02:19:40,389 --> 02:19:40,999
He is my son.

1326
02:19:41,218 --> 02:19:45,379
I know, it is because of him that
we are talking about marriage.

1327
02:19:50,440 --> 02:19:53,694
I'm here to talk about the marriage preparation.
-One minute.

1328
02:19:57,263 --> 02:20:00,788
Let’s fix upon a date and time
for the wedding proceedings.

1329
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:05,897
You can talk to my son about it.

1330
02:20:08,708 --> 02:20:09,882
We’ll approve to whatever he says.

1331
02:20:47,493 --> 02:20:48,973
I don’t want anything. Take it off.

1332
02:20:49,653 --> 02:20:51,293
I said I don’t want anything. Go away!

1333
02:20:57,899 --> 02:20:59,518
Did you call me, sir? -Take me out.

1334
02:20:59,921 --> 02:21:01,241
Doctors advised otherwise, sir.

1335
02:21:02,059 --> 02:21:02,503
Go away!

1336
02:21:06,690 --> 02:21:07,870
Shall I call Srinu?

1337
02:21:10,277 --> 02:21:10,823
No.

1338
02:21:12,090 --> 02:21:16,323
Let him live his life. Don’t disturb him.

1339
02:21:51,933 --> 02:21:55,979
Tell me, sir..
-Can you meet Vikram?

1340
02:21:56,139 --> 02:21:56,823
Of course, sir..

1341
02:22:00,651 --> 02:22:01,261
What happened, sir?

1342
02:22:03,417 --> 02:22:06,428
I thought he’d miss nothing in life after the Paris trip.

1343
02:22:06,476 --> 02:22:08,796
But he’s missing life after you left.

1344
02:22:10,013 --> 02:22:11,300
He asked me not to call you..

1345
02:22:12,342 --> 02:22:14,089
But I got scared looking at his condition.

1346
02:22:15,004 --> 02:22:15,401
Go...

1347
02:22:24,417 --> 02:22:25,034
Brother..

1348
02:22:44,369 --> 02:22:47,569
What’s this, brother?
Why do you look like heartbroken kid?

1349
02:22:51,268 --> 02:22:52,058
Srinu..

1350
02:22:53,737 --> 02:22:57,128
I’m unable to breathe here. Let’s go out.

1351
02:23:42,672 --> 02:23:43,487
What do we do now?

1352
02:23:45,834 --> 02:23:46,878
Let me decide that.

1353
02:24:31,654 --> 02:24:32,657
See..

1354
02:24:35,451 --> 02:24:39,267
Just the hat and you’ll look like Quickgun Murugan.
-It doesn’t look good.

1355
02:24:45,298 --> 02:24:49,759
You look like a villain from Bruce Lee’s movies.
-Are you playing around with me?

1356
02:24:50,036 --> 02:24:51,103
It’s been long, right?

1357
02:25:02,133 --> 02:25:04,399
You look like Cupid now.

1358
02:25:04,916 --> 02:25:07,316
What will happen to the girls
if you grow your beard?

1359
02:25:09,731 --> 02:25:13,642
I was a plain sheet of paper.
You turned me into a painting.

1360
02:25:15,067 --> 02:25:17,627
When you asked me to go with my mother,
I was scared.

1361
02:25:18,116 --> 02:25:20,626
But when I was with her I realised..

1362
02:25:21,900 --> 02:25:23,517
You don’t need money to live.

1363
02:25:24,568 --> 02:25:27,150
Even one soul who loves you is enough
to get you through life.

1364
02:25:29,059 --> 02:25:33,540
What you need now is not an attender
who wipes away your tears.

1365
02:25:33,914 --> 02:25:36,048
But a companion
who does not let you shed tears.

1366
02:25:37,900 --> 02:25:38,986
That day you asked me to leave.

1367
02:25:40,159 --> 02:25:41,064
I am leaving now.

1368
02:25:50,129 --> 02:25:51,548
You can’t escape from here now.

1369
02:25:53,401 --> 02:25:55,251
Your hands and legs don’t move.

1370
02:25:56,242 --> 02:25:57,619
Your heart’s still beating.

1371
02:25:59,801 --> 02:26:00,814
Don’t stop it.

1372
02:26:05,458 --> 02:26:06,275
Hey, Srinu!

1373
02:26:07,274 --> 02:26:07,689
Srinu!

1374
02:26:08,603 --> 02:26:09,103
Srinu.

1375
02:26:57,288 --> 02:26:58,431
How are you, Vikram?

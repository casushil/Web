1
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:53,416
You haven’t changed.

2
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:55,869
I learnt that from you.

3
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,885
Stop.. Stop..

4
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:12,065
Stop.. stop..

5
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:15,885
Stop! Stop!

6
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,424
Hello.. control room.

7
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:36,327
I can bet Rs.10, 000. They won’t catch up with me. -Game.

8
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:52,955
I told you they wouldn’t be able to catch up with us.
Ten thousand…

9
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,580
What happened to your bet?

10
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:09,226
It’s my turn to bet Rs. 10,000.
These policemen will escort us.

11
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,494
What? -Get out of the car.

12
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,572
How dare you speed away without stopping?
Are you drunk?

13
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:15,237
I don’t drink. -Blow!!

14
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:16,557
Blow it properly.

15
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,237
What’s this, sir? Will you kill me?
Won’t you help an innocent?

16
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:27,682
Look at him...
he’s critical. I’m taking him to the hospital.

17
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:29,143
He can’t even move his limbs.

18
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:31,508
Look at him, sir.

19
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:33,697
Did you see that? If anything happens to him,

20
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:36,482
I’ll tell the media that you are responsible.

21
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:38,893
No, sir. Please check. I’ll go only after that.

22
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:40,682
Go away! -No, sir. Please check. I’ll go only after that.

23
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:43,690
Go away. Leave! Why are you dragging it?

24
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:45,713
Get into the car, Take him to the hospital.

25
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,197
Hey, bring the car.

26
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,252
Are they escorting us?

27
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,221
I suggest, we’ll go ahead.
You follow us. We’ll clear the road for you.

28
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:01,338
Is that okay? -Yes.

29
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:02,565
Good, Just follow us.

30
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:06,299
Turn on the siren, sir.

31
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,416
Hey, turn on the siren.

32
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:10,651
Stop. They left.

33
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,479
You acted very well. -Learnt it from you, right?

34
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:19,221
I win 20,000. -Alright.

35
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,627
I just have one childhood wish...
-To be escorted by the cops. It’s finally fulfilled.

36
00:07:57,526 --> 00:07:58,757
The inspector is coming. -What?

37
00:07:58,846 --> 00:07:59,827
The inspector is coming!

38
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,083
Is he all right? -Ok sir..

39
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:07,203
Bring a stretcher?
-Please don’t trouble yourself.
I will manage

40
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:10,290
Just one man like you can make a
difference to the police force…

41
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:15,778
Actually that's my job.. -Please carry on. I will manage.

42
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:16,820
Take care.

43
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:25,945
What do we do now?

44
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:29,382
-I will decide that.

45
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,921
Lingam Uncle...

46
00:09:16,563 --> 00:09:18,624
How are you uncle.. -Hey.. hey.

47
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:21,995
You’ve no clue how much I missed you.
-Inside the jail?

48
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:24,766
I was told that I’ve been given a ‘role’. What is it?

49
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,382
Yes, you’ve been given the ‘role’ of ‘Kattappa’
in the movie ‘Baahubali 2’.

50
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:28,843
Don’t make fun of me.

51
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:30,702
You have been released on ‘parole’.

52
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,796
You’ve been sentenced to two years of imprisonment.

53
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:37,890
I’ve battled the last six months
to get you a 4-month parole.

54
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:40,429
These four months, You must maintain good conduct.

55
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:43,312
Can you explain it in Telugu?

56
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,241
I am speaking in Telugu, right?

57
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:49,243
Good conduct as in well mannered.

58
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:55,123
Henceforth, you must do good to the society
and prove that you’re harmless.

59
00:09:55,203 --> 00:09:57,734
The court will close your case
if they believe that you’ve changed.

60
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,780
What if they don’t believe?
-You’ll be sent back to jail.

61
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,523
Back to jail. No way! I will listen to you.

62
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:08,726
Hey, Srinu... -You’re hopeless gang is here.

63
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,679
Hey, Srinu...

64
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:13,109
You’re a hero, dude. -What’s all this?

65
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:15,243
Because you’ve been released from the jail.

66
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:17,723
So much for coming back from the prison.
Felicitations and cheers!

67
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:19,643
Uncle, come here. -I’m coming.

68
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:28,978
Go..

69
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:53,416
That’s irrelevant. You must tell me.

70
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:55,517
Where has mother gone?

71
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:57,103
She hasn’t gone yet. She is alive.

72
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:25,563
Where are you going?

73
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:30,844
I’ve told you so many times
not to be in the company of those boys.

74
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,356
Who are you to question me?

75
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:34,697
Are you trying to act big
because you are my older brother?

76
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:36,197
Have you forgotten that you’ve just come out of jail?

77
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,806
Don’t lecture me.

78
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:57,049
Swathi? -Mother.. Mother’s here. I’ll call you back

79
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:17,150
Why did you come back?

80
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,451
I thought you would go away.

81
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,940
Why did you come back?

82
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:26,174
I believed you would change
and take over my responsibilities.

83
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:28,572
You shattered my belief six months back.

84
00:12:28,891 --> 00:12:31,150
We’ve got used to the idea of living a life without you.

85
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:34,156
It never occurs to you that
you have a brother and sister…

86
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:36,267
Your sister…

87
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,096
Sorry… My Daughter.

88
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:45,135
Nobody wants to marry my daughter
because her brother went to prison.

89
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:49,181
Your brother is disobedient just like you.
He is whiling away time on the roadside.

90
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:55,628
I am scared thinking of things
that could happen because you are around.

91
00:12:57,532 --> 00:12:58,072
Go away.

92
00:13:00,283 --> 00:13:00,830
Mother...

93
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:08,502
We don’t need you here.
Leave now.

94
00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:33,364
Are you drinking because you’ve been released from the jail?
Or because your mother disowned you?

95
00:13:33,494 --> 00:13:34,502
Give us some clarity.

96
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:37,135
What the hell is wrong with my mother?

97
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:38,775
Why does she expect me to be like her?

98
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:43,791
She wakes up early, does all the work at home,
packs her lunch and goes to work.

99
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:52,033
She has to salute all her superiors at work.
She is exhausted when she returns home.

100
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:55,736
At the end of the month,
she has no money left even for her bus fare.

101
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:57,056
How can one lead a life like that?

102
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:59,150
I don’t understand how they can live such a life?

103
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:05,283
If the police hadn’t caught us,
our lives would have been different.

104
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:14,838
You can be charged for drinking in a public place.

105
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:18,033
Your parole will be cancelled
and you have to serve extra time in the jail.

106
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,924
Where are you? -I am on Google.

107
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,924
I will call you tomorrow. Wind up and leave.

108
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:28,684
Where do I go?

109
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:38,846
Have you brought me to an orphanage because
I have been thrown out of my house?

110
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:45,213
This orphanage is for little children.
Not for grownups like you.

111
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:46,658
Come along.

112
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:49,718
What should I do here?
-They need a volunteer to look after the children.

113
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:54,731
If you do some good deeds, the court will close your case.

114
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,588
Good conduct, remember?

115
00:14:56,744 --> 00:14:59,174
You’ve an interview now. Let’s go.
-An interview? Yeah.

116
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,093
Tell me? -Here’s the nice guy
I was talking to you about.

117
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,573
What were you doing before this?

118
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:06,814
I got out of jail only yesterday.

119
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,736
Didn’t you tell him?

120
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:19,236
Why did you tell him that you were in jail?
-You asked me to maintain good conduct, right?

121
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:23,564
I’m diabetic. I can’t take this!

122
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:25,291
Where are we going next?

123
00:15:28,314 --> 00:15:30,385
You must wake up at 5 in the morning. -That early?

124
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,763
Listen to me...

125
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:35,516
You have to wake him up by 6 am
and get him ready by 7am.

126
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:36,127
Let's go.

127
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:44,284
At 11 pm…

128
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:47,174
Wait, When do I go to sleep?

129
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,439
Good Question, I will show you the bedroom.

130
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:53,064
Will I have my own bedroom?
-Yes, we shall provide with attached bathroom, come..

131
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:58,752
You call this a bedroom.
-Yes.

132
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:01,301
That is the bed and this is the room.

133
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,330
That’s the bathroom.

134
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:12,900
Do you like it?

135
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:20,539
You look like a ‘Clean India’ evangelist.
What happened?

136
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:23,807
This is a very difficult job.
Being in jail is easier.
Over there I have 10 people to work for me.

137
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:26,471
But here, I have to do 10 men’s work.
This won’t work out.

138
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:29,495
Find me a job where I have to work for just one person.
You have the nerve to be choosy?

139
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:32,237
Uncle, where are we going?

140
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:36,362
You asked me to look for one person, right?
I found one.

141
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:39,206
But you won’t fit the cadre.

142
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:42,565
Who are you do decide that? Let’s just go there.

143
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,948
Uncle... -Yes.

144
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:59,455
This is my thing. -yeah, right!

145
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:01,862
I can do this for 4 years and not 4 months.

146
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:03,729
Go inside..

147
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:19,924
How do they make so much money?

148
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:27,690
They fired so many people at once?

149
00:17:28,707 --> 00:17:29,784
I stand no chance.

150
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,209
I should definitely get this job.

151
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,213
Hey, Who is he?

152
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:36,428
You don’t know him? -No.

153
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:40,274
Vikramaditya, A leading businessman. In fortune 500...
-That’s enough.

154
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:43,068
Who is that girl who followed him inside?

155
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,623
That’s his secretary.

156
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:49,272
Where can we find such girls?
I don’t get to see any on the road.

157
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:51,819
She is mine.

158
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:54,715
I meant the job. -The job is mine.

159
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:57,545
Rambabu.. -Sir.

160
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,217
Good morning sir..

161
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,241
Why did you choose this job?

162
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:10,173
My blood group is O Positive.
Helping people is in my blood.

163
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:14,678
I haven’t kept a photo of my mother in my house.
I’ve only hung a photo of Mother Theresa.

164
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:17,743
A lot of people have said that
they feel a ‘positive vibration’ around me.

165
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:18,608
Sudhakar.

166
00:19:19,212 --> 00:19:20,692
Why did you choose this job?

167
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:23,779
I’ve been nursing a 90 years old man.

168
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:27,327
He’s passed away last week.
He said he’d miss me before he died.

169
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,092
He said life would be good if one had
someone like me for company.

170
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,163
I am soft-hearted.
I’ve also done my M.B.A.

171
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:38,436
I can also manage your business.

172
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:39,928
What is your ambition?

173
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:40,515
Money.

174
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:41,819
Humanitarianism.

175
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,631
Service.

176
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:13,514
Sridhar.. -Sir.

177
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:15,936
Wait. How long should I wait here?

178
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:17,459
Where do these guys come from!

179
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:32,834
Why did you choose this job?

180
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:39,045
I liked the house at first sight and
I also liked you at first sight.

181
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:51,061
Have you done this kind of work earlier?
-Do you mean social service?

182
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:58,648
I was 4. I nursed an injured dog on
the road and gave some food.

183
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:02,827
I donated blood on Powerstar’s birthday.
I donated my friend’s eyes on Superstar’s birthday.

184
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:08,045
I donated food on Rebelstar’s birthday.
I just donated something at an orphanage.

185
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,334
I’d never say all that.

186
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:16,016
Uncle Lingam is insisting that
I maintain good conduct and that’s why I’m here.

187
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:18,366
What’s your ambition?

188
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:21,577
I don’t have any big ambition.
I have a different one every day.

189
00:21:21,921 --> 00:21:24,233
Today, my ambition is to woo her.

190
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:28,225
Can I have your phone number?

191
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:30,397
Oh.. it's alright.

192
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,100
Here’s my number.

193
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:38,945
I’ve free outgoing after 10. I’ll call you back
if you give me a missed call.

194
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:41,717
See ya!

195
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,319
What’s your name?

196
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,827
Srinu. -You’ve always been dependable.

197
00:21:50,937 --> 00:21:52,397
Yes, Just like you.

198
00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:56,098
What are you talking. Do you have sense?

199
00:21:56,217 --> 00:21:59,186
You’ll say whatever you want?
Do you have any sense? Idiot.

200
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:00,522
You are appointed.

201
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:05,702
What? -You can join tomorrow.

202
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:18,022
Hey! Who are you?

203
00:22:18,312 --> 00:22:18,998
Where are you going?

204
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:20,459
Who are you?

205
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:24,827
I’ve been the chief servant
of this mansion for 30 years.

206
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:26,523
A servant?

207
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:28,702
I was worried if you were the owner.

208
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:31,139
You are late on your very first day at work!

209
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:35,873
Who is this fellow?
He is the new caretaker appointed by the boss.

210
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:37,116
This fellow!

211
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:38,686
Come along.

212
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:42,616
Go and get a strong cup of coffee for me. -Get lost!

213
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:46,217
You have to wake up at 6
every morning and get ready.

214
00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:47,858
Wake up the boss at 7 am and serve him coffee.

215
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:49,603
His physiotherapist will be here at 8 am sharp.

216
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:52,643
Learn all the exercises from the physiotherapist.
It will be your job from now on.

217
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:55,038
You have to serve breakfast at 9 am.

218
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,608
Breakfast? I already had mine.

219
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:03,014
Have this walkie-talkie with you.

220
00:23:03,697 --> 00:23:06,295
You’ll be able to hear his instructions here.

221
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,256
You must react in no time.

222
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:11,405
There is one more important thing
that I have to say.

223
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:12,373
What is it?

224
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:14,647
Don’t waste your time following me around.

225
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,928
Meenakshi said the
same thing when I met her first.

226
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,069
Who is Meenakshi? -My ex-girlfriend.

227
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,194
This is your room.

228
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:32,319
Is this my room?

229
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:35,545
You have to keep the room clean and in order. -Ok.

230
00:23:37,936 --> 00:23:39,334
This is your bathroom.

231
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,663
This looks like the ones
I’ve seen in the Hollywood movies.

232
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:54,827
Come, let us go and meet the boss.

233
00:23:55,718 --> 00:23:57,030
Give me 2 minutes. -Ok, hurry up.

234
00:24:04,488 --> 00:24:06,108
Why are you looking at me?

235
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,913
Thank you. That’s an awesome bathroom.

236
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:19,298
What are you doing?

237
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,108
I didn’t know he is a quadriplegic.
Thought it was only his legs.

238
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:28,214
Sir, I don’t think this fellow will last a week.

239
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:30,123
Why are you wasting your time on him?

240
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:34,201
Looking at some people, you just wish you could
spend the rest of your life here.

241
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:39,741
My job is to just take care of you. Right?
Why is she making a big fuss?

242
00:24:39,963 --> 00:24:41,780
You will understand as time goes by.

243
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:46,603
Fold.. Stretch... watch carefully.

244
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,123
Every bone and muscle of your body must move.

245
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,077
You must not forget that.
He must exercise in the morning and evening.

246
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:57,069
Without fail. And be very careful, okay?

247
00:24:58,711 --> 00:24:59,475
Did you get it?

248
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:03,209
Hey!

249
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:06,428
After hands... -I was doing the legs now. Not hands.

250
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,159
Did you notice how she is doing?

251
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,061
I saw everything.
-Make him sit on the wheelchair.

252
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,061
Lift him up.

253
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:38,623
Anything else?

254
00:25:44,393 --> 00:25:45,756
Buckle him up.

255
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:51,936
You should have been careful.
-How would I know? You should have told me.

256
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:54,405
Give him a bath.

257
00:25:54,702 --> 00:25:56,256
What did you say? -Give him a bath.

258
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:58,311
I can’t give him a bath.

259
00:26:05,848 --> 00:26:06,467
What next?

260
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:09,444
These regulate the blood circulation in his legs.

261
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:11,694
I gave him a bath. My work ends there.
I can’t do all this.

262
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,897
Keerthi, he will do it.
You leave.

263
00:26:14,983 --> 00:26:19,147
You can’t expect me to do everything just because
you’ve given me a luxurious bathroom.

264
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:33,006
It's alright.

265
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:38,780
Thanks.

266
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:42,923
Uncle, you didn’t tell me before.
Must brush his teeth, give him a shower, oil his hair.

267
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:45,163
I can’t do all that. Look for something else.
-Hey, idiot.

268
00:26:45,551 --> 00:26:47,436
Almost everybody has rejected you.

269
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,441
I wonder how he liked you. Bear with it for four months.

270
00:26:52,704 --> 00:26:56,264
After yoru case is closed, I’ll talk to Anwar
from Sharjah and fix up something for you.

271
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:57,624
I’m at the court. Hang up now.

272
00:26:57,724 --> 00:26:59,044
Hello.. hello..

273
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:02,709
4 months?

274
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:06,113
Srinu.. Srinu...

275
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:09,082
Srinu.. Srinu...

276
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:10,506
Srinu.. -What, sir?

277
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:11,443
I want water.

278
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,084
Good morning, sir. -Good morning.

279
00:27:29,577 --> 00:27:31,257
Hey.. Srinu!

280
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:37,858
Must send that to the lawyer, Keep it in the brown file.

281
00:27:40,151 --> 00:27:41,670
That’s personal. Keep it in the black one.

282
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:05,288
What are you doing?

283
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:08,311
It’s so hot and he can’t feel a thing.

284
00:28:09,217 --> 00:28:10,108
Idiot.

285
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:12,682
Are you playing with me?

286
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:14,358
Can’t you feel anything, sir?

287
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:28,408
Hello.. Okay, I’ll call back later.

288
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:30,467
Sir..

289
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:34,522
Calling you sir feels like I’m back to school.
And I always hated school.

290
00:28:34,655 --> 00:28:36,413
Usually I call everyone with some relation.

291
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,959
Can I call you...
-What do you wanna call me?

292
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,452
Can I call you brother?

293
00:28:50,441 --> 00:28:51,803
What’s this, brother?

294
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:57,061
Where do such girls live?

295
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,022
Paris. -Did you ever go?

296
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,592
Many times. It’s my favourite city.

297
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:07,553
Whenever I felt stressed I’d escape to Paris.

298
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,090
Get me a bottle of alcohol when you go next time.

299
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:18,553
You’ve so many cars parked here.

300
00:29:19,077 --> 00:29:20,194
Which one should we hop into?

301
00:29:20,545 --> 00:29:22,842
We’re not going in a car. We are taking the van.

302
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,014
This is not a van. It’s an ambulance.

303
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:28,061
You’re not a patient to commute in that.

304
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:32,647
Doctors say that
it’s not right for me to commute in a car.

305
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:37,937
You rich people, listen to your doctors and babas.

306
00:29:38,536 --> 00:29:41,656
I’m not up for an ambulance. Choose a car!

307
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:42,967
Which car do you like?

308
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,609
Why does it sound like that, brother? -Go on.

309
00:29:57,185 --> 00:30:00,475
I’m scared what he’ll do next.

310
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:27,717
It’s been an hour. How long willl you stare
at a white board with red paint, brother?

311
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,209
That painting is talking to me, Srinu.

312
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:34,592
I can’t hear anything.

313
00:30:34,998 --> 00:30:36,897
Do you know the greatness of art?

314
00:30:37,655 --> 00:30:41,319
You must tell me..
-It remains even after we’re dead and gone.

315
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:45,459
Stop it, brother. The only thing that’ll
remain is a photo frame hanging on the wall.

316
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:48,178
what’s the price? -20 Lakhs.

317
00:30:48,864 --> 00:30:49,504
What?

318
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:52,295
He bought a painting worth 20 Lakhs.

319
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:55,397
Just imagine the number of pegs
I’d get in the same amount.

320
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:57,827
Hang up. I need to go.

321
00:30:58,425 --> 00:30:59,264
Hello..

322
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,272
Hi, Vikram. -Hi.

323
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:10,986
Sorry. I’m late.
-It’s a routine for lawyers, right?

324
00:31:11,323 --> 00:31:14,913
I'm not here as your company’s legal advisor.
-You had something important to say.

325
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:16,433
You selected someone I believe.

326
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:19,670
You liked him of all you interviewed?

327
00:31:20,785 --> 00:31:23,725
He spilled hot water on your legs
to check if you can feel it.

328
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:25,858
Stupid fellow.  Do you know who he is?

329
00:31:26,842 --> 00:31:29,303
A thief. He’s out on parole.

330
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,155
They are not kind and compassionate.

331
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:43,073
What if he harms you flee away, we’d be helpless.

332
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:46,678
You know your condition, right?
You should have given it a thought.

333
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:50,631
That’s it? Or there’s more?

334
00:31:51,935 --> 00:31:55,147
It’s been 5 years since the accident.

335
00:31:55,761 --> 00:32:00,081
Why do you all pity my life on wheelchair?

336
00:32:01,647 --> 00:32:02,514
I can’t take it.

337
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,233
It’s annoying.

338
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:08,975
Whatever you just said to me was also out of pity.

339
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:12,319
Exactly, he doesn’t pity me.

340
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:15,075
I want that.

341
00:32:16,406 --> 00:32:21,856
He asks me to talk on the phone
and completely ignores that I’m paralysed.

342
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,559
I don’t care about his past.

343
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:29,577
I need someone like him in my life right now.

344
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:36,168
You were saying something? About him harming me...

345
00:32:37,786 --> 00:32:39,583
I’ve no hopes from my life anymore.

346
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:43,005
Why would I fear that
he will do something to me.

347
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:46,309
You never listen to me anyway.

348
00:32:47,385 --> 00:32:51,227
In this world, he is of no use to anyone except you.

349
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,094
Srinu.

350
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,358
Brother?

351
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:01,144
Srinu, meet my best friend Prasad.

352
00:33:03,432 --> 00:33:05,867
Sir, I think I’ve seen you before.

353
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:11,258
You’re an antagonist from Hindi dubbed films, right?

354
00:33:19,653 --> 00:33:20,305
See you, sir.

355
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:22,180
Stupid fellow.

356
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:30,180
I’ve decided today, brother.
All you need is money to live the way you want.

357
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:30,812
What?

358
00:33:31,024 --> 00:33:35,123
Look, your hands and legs don’t work.
Still you’re living life king size

359
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:36,953
That’s the power of money.

360
00:33:38,328 --> 00:33:43,203
A painting worth 20 lakhs. That’s life!

361
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:12,710
Hey, you think I can’t do it. Now, look here.

362
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,132
Sorry.

363
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,195
Brother.

364
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:49,054
Brother, what happened?

365
00:35:00,045 --> 00:35:01,875
Nothing will happen...

366
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,195
Nothing will happen, brother.

367
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:39,078
Brother..

368
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:41,601
I can’t breathe.

369
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:45,937
Get me out of here.

370
00:35:58,196 --> 00:36:02,115
Where are we going?
-You wanted to get out, right?

371
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:06,820
I meant to the lawn.

372
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:10,265
You breathe that air all the time.
-Where are you taking me now?

373
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,000
They don’t sell that.

374
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:30,015
I’m scared you’ll ask its price.

375
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:32,382
What happened to you before?

376
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:34,978
It’s a minor medical issue.
-A medical problem?

377
00:36:35,265 --> 00:36:38,836
Stop it, brother.
You’d feel that way if you sit in the house all the time.

378
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:45,171
You must go out sometimes.
Not just salads you must eat dum biriyani too.

379
00:36:50,012 --> 00:36:52,711
Not just AC cars you must go on bike rides too.

380
00:36:54,897 --> 00:36:56,164
Me? One  a bike?

381
00:36:57,045 --> 00:36:58,726
You can’t hop on?

382
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:04,539
Let’s exchange our vehicles for 30 minutes

383
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,695
Brother, shall we ride?

384
00:37:20,132 --> 00:37:22,281
You must also get a bike like this. -What?

385
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:24,164
You must get a bike..

386
00:37:24,665 --> 00:37:25,921
only then will I get a chance..

387
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:19,804
Your eyes are watering because of the
wind against your face.

388
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:24,054
That’s not why my eyes are watering.

389
00:40:30,824 --> 00:40:31,324
That is personal.

390
00:42:33,977 --> 00:42:36,778
Did you paint? -Yes, brother. I painted it.

391
00:42:37,074 --> 00:42:41,714
You paid 20 lakhs for one colour.
I used so many here. I might get 2 lakhs at least.

392
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:46,600
What were you thinking?
-An artist doesn’t reveal what he feels.

393
00:42:46,774 --> 00:42:48,258
The viewer must understand that.

394
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:51,256
How is the painting?

395
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:55,778
I couldn’t find the toilet brush. Did you take it?

396
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,657
Get lost!

397
00:42:58,801 --> 00:43:02,041
it’s like you painted it with your face.

398
00:43:02,375 --> 00:43:04,297
Place it at the entrance. It’ll purge away evil’s eye.

399
00:43:04,446 --> 00:43:06,403
A painter who can’t handle his pants!

400
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:13,594
He’s like a flower to my stem. Hello?

401
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:16,599
Anwar called me from Sharjah this morning.
He got me a job there.

402
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:19,666
I must go away once the case is closed.
You better take care of the arrangements.

403
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:23,243
Why are you in a hurry?
-I’ll exhaust my balance. Recharge my mobile for Rs. 500

404
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,111
One spicy omelette.

405
00:43:26,226 --> 00:43:29,641
Are you leaving? -Not right now, After 3 months.

406
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:33,759
Vikram, you’re trying to me avoid me.

407
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:38,976
But I can’t forget you and
I know you can’t forget me either.

408
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:41,163
Oh, no!

409
00:43:41,746 --> 00:43:44,384
Look. All you need is money. -Ah?

410
00:43:44,993 --> 00:43:48,095
I was wondering why isn’t she falling for me.
Now you know.

411
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:51,217
What? -Didn’t you hear that? Kirthi is hitting on him.

412
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:53,738
You’ve no control on what you say.
Do you have sense?

413
00:43:53,793 --> 00:43:56,673
She’s reading his letter.

414
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,197
What?

415
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,533
A letter? -Yes. A letter.

416
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:03,123
The blue one, the personal one.

417
00:44:03,217 --> 00:44:03,572
The same one.

418
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:04,728
What’s the matter?

419
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:14,612
Promise me you won’t tell anyone.

420
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:15,783
Tell me quickly.

421
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:22,057
He visits these art exhibitions very often, right?

422
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:28,969
He liked a painting and
wrote a letter to an artist. Guess who she is.

423
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,337
Who? -A girl.

424
00:44:31,603 --> 00:44:32,540
Superb.

425
00:44:33,064 --> 00:44:36,803
They’ve been writing to each other
for over a year now. -And then...?

426
00:44:37,643 --> 00:44:42,603
6 months ago, the girl said she likes him.

427
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,642
And that she wants to meet him. -Amazing.

428
00:44:46,258 --> 00:44:49,009
Since then he stopped replying to her letters.

429
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:52,408
Is it? -that girl is continuing to write to him.

430
00:44:55,954 --> 00:45:00,578
How can they not meet and write to each other. How?

431
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:02,939
Ask him only. -Correct.

432
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:06,003
hey.. hey.. hey.. -Trust me, I’ll take care of it.

433
00:45:06,043 --> 00:45:07,483
-Stop. I beg you.

434
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,892
Damn, I can never keep a secret.

435
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:12,845
I hope you’ll change your mind someday.

436
00:45:13,314 --> 00:45:14,963
Srinu, wait outside for 5 minutes.

437
00:45:15,073 --> 00:45:17,189
What? -Wait for 5 minutes.

438
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,809
You must turn it off if it’s personal.

439
00:45:20,961 --> 00:45:23,994
Now it’s public.
Your servant has broadcasted the information already.

440
00:45:25,213 --> 00:45:26,173
Hey. -Srinu.

441
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,822
How dare you take the letter. Give it back.
-What’s this, brother?

442
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:32,853
Despite all the chasing she ain’t falling for me.
And you don’t care about the girl who fell for you.

443
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,564
That’s too much, brother. This is against the nature.

444
00:45:36,008 --> 00:45:37,439
Her phone number is here.

445
00:45:37,698 --> 00:45:40,578
My outgoing costs are very reasonable.
-Don’t call her, Srinu. No, don’t call her.

446
00:45:40,817 --> 00:45:41,658
Please, Srinu.

447
00:45:43,113 --> 00:45:45,073
Hang up. Srinu, stop it!

448
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:46,361
Srinu. -Hello.

449
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,370
Her voice is amazing. talk to her. -Hello.

450
00:45:50,525 --> 00:45:52,003
No. -Talk!

451
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:53,767
Talk! -Hello.

452
00:45:54,497 --> 00:45:55,783
Hello.. -Priya.

453
00:45:56,593 --> 00:46:01,751
This is Vikram.
I’ve been meaning to call you. But couldn’t.

454
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:03,798
Just a minute. I’ll pass on the phone to Priya.

455
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:07,962
The feeling is amazing. Continue with the flow.

456
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:10,329
Talk to her. What are you doing there? Come here.

457
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:12,345
Hello..

458
00:46:12,914 --> 00:46:13,478
Vikram.

459
00:46:18,074 --> 00:46:20,251
Talk to her, brother.

460
00:46:23,523 --> 00:46:24,001
Priya.

461
00:46:26,944 --> 00:46:27,462
Vikram..

462
00:46:28,657 --> 00:46:30,611
Hey, where is Vikram?

463
00:46:31,483 --> 00:46:32,236
He’s busy.

464
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,267
He was avoiding the phone yesterday.
Today, he isn’t leaving it.

465
00:46:37,617 --> 00:46:38,720
Who is it?

466
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:41,119
It’s personal.

467
00:46:42,305 --> 00:46:44,111
It’ll take only 5 minutes, Please be seated.

468
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,020
This painting is for me? -Yes.

469
00:46:56,418 --> 00:46:57,884
Yes, from where did you get?

470
00:46:58,887 --> 00:47:00,048
From London. -WoW!

471
00:47:00,705 --> 00:47:01,892
How much? - Two Lakhs.

472
00:47:06,439 --> 00:47:07,072
How is it?

473
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,431
I don't understand what this artist conveying.

474
00:47:10,178 --> 00:47:12,298
What is this Prasad, I expected you to recognize it.

475
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:14,393
Yes, I didn't see it properly.

476
00:47:15,401 --> 00:47:15,939
Let me see.

477
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:26,540
Yes! I got it.

478
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:31,329
That Red, Yellow, Blue and Orange.

479
00:47:31,866 --> 00:47:33,806
They are expressing the feelings of a Human.

480
00:47:34,202 --> 00:47:36,603
Prasad, you're a Genius.

481
00:47:37,026 --> 00:47:37,744
Thank you.

482
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:40,767
I'll buy it.

483
00:47:41,815 --> 00:47:45,087
You know my taste. -Yes, very well.

484
00:47:49,238 --> 00:47:51,483
Sir, we got the land contact and we checked it and... -
Did you call me, brother?

485
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:53,369
Yes, bring me that cover.

486
00:47:58,847 --> 00:47:59,519
What’s all this, brother?

487
00:48:00,017 --> 00:48:01,590
That’s the amount you got for your painting. Two Lakhs.

488
00:48:03,723 --> 00:48:05,066
My painting? -Yes.

489
00:48:06,898 --> 00:48:08,800
This is the first time I earned so much money.

490
00:48:10,928 --> 00:48:12,449
This is the first time ever I made money.

491
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:19,465
I used to get weird feelings
when I saw white paper as a child.

492
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,690
To do something. To draw something.
I didn’t understand anything back then.

493
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:25,535
But now I know... No one can stop me now, brother.

494
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:29,649
No one can stop me. I’ll prove myself.
I’ll continue to paint.

495
00:48:43,794 --> 00:48:46,246
It’s been really long I saw you.

496
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:48,980
Well...

497
00:48:49,403 --> 00:48:54,121
(Phone ringing)

498
00:48:59,129 --> 00:48:59,754
What’s this?

499
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,754
Srinu asked me to give this to you.

500
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,496
What?

501
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:06,483
Srinu asked me to give you this money.

502
00:49:15,345 --> 00:49:16,308
He’ll never change.

503
00:49:26,705 --> 00:49:31,597
Tell him that he’s distanced himself
a little more from the family.

504
00:49:33,585 --> 00:49:38,129
I’ve been the breadwinner of this family.
And will continue to be.

505
00:49:38,641 --> 00:49:41,230
We don’t need his sympathy. Leave!

506
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:47,432
I told you, right?
Your mother will never believe you.

507
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,324
What are you doing, dude?
What do you have to do with him?

508
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,918
Once again... Brother... I’ll see you in the evening.

509
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:00,996
You leave now.

510
00:50:03,297 --> 00:50:03,769
Hey!

511
00:50:04,937 --> 00:50:06,082
Go away!

512
00:50:15,081 --> 00:50:18,041
Sir, you’ve got some mails. -Any letters?

513
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:23,458
Yes, sir. One from TIME magazine,
one from the bank and one is a wedding card.

514
00:50:23,569 --> 00:50:26,129
That’s it. Anything else? -That’s all, sir.

515
00:50:27,536 --> 00:50:29,058
Okay, leave me alone.

516
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:31,097
Yes sir. -Srinu.

517
00:50:31,992 --> 00:50:32,582
Even you can leave.

518
00:50:36,256 --> 00:50:37,004
Brother..

519
00:50:38,049 --> 00:50:40,691
Were you talking about this letter?

520
00:50:42,496 --> 00:50:44,988
But this doesn’t look like a letter. Is it a photograph?

521
00:50:45,215 --> 00:50:48,058
Matters have moved from phone to photo.
-Srinu! Leave the letter here.

522
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,523
Hey, Srinu!
listen to me, Srinu.

523
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:52,457
Srinu.. No No No!

524
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:01,011
Brother, you are so done.

525
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,644
There’s something written behind.

526
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,215
Coming to Hyderabad on the 11th.
Hope we can catch up.

527
00:51:22,457 --> 00:51:23,590
Hello, subtitles!

528
00:51:24,928 --> 00:51:26,761
Read it in Telugu, I must understand, right?

529
00:51:27,465 --> 00:51:30,665
She’s coming to Hyderabad on 11th
and was asking if he could catch up.

530
00:51:31,017 --> 00:51:33,497
We are so catching up. Right, brother?
What do you think, brother?

531
00:51:37,226 --> 00:51:37,894
How is it brother?

532
00:51:39,593 --> 00:51:42,144
Even I thought the same, This doesn't suit.

533
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:47,136
Its not good.

534
00:51:48,808 --> 00:51:49,629
This is too good.

535
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:53,121
Don’t drag the matter any further,
We must take a decision.

536
00:51:54,086 --> 00:51:55,066
Srinu... -What’s it, brother?

537
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:56,925
You can’t come with me. -Why?

538
00:51:57,632 --> 00:51:58,504
You talk too much.

539
00:52:00,673 --> 00:52:01,363
All right, brother.

540
00:52:03,194 --> 00:52:04,754
But you don’t talk too little.

541
00:52:13,073 --> 00:52:14,222
Kirthi... -Yes sir.

542
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,457
What’s the time?

543
00:52:16,064 --> 00:52:18,944
5.40 -We have 20 minutes more.

544
00:52:24,746 --> 00:52:25,793
Kirthi.. -Sir?

545
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:27,073
What’s the time?

546
00:52:27,774 --> 00:52:28,379
5.50

547
00:52:33,143 --> 00:52:33,871
What’s the time?

548
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,050
5.51, sir..

549
00:52:39,104 --> 00:52:39,707
Let’s go..

550
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:44,910
There’s 5 minutes more, sir.
-I said, let’s go!

551
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,136
What’s it, brother? You didn’t meet her?

552
00:53:07,697 --> 00:53:11,035
That’s why you asked me to stay away?
I was right there. Something’s scaring you

553
00:53:12,261 --> 00:53:14,323
You’re scared of writing a letter.
Scared of talking on the phone.

554
00:53:14,472 --> 00:53:16,625
You’re scared of meeting her. What’s the problem?

555
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:17,254
Srinu.

556
00:53:18,665 --> 00:53:21,496
I don’t need to answer every question of you, Srinu.

557
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,207
Be in your limits.

558
00:53:27,855 --> 00:53:29,175
Kirthi... -Sir.
let’s go.

559
00:53:34,988 --> 00:53:36,203
Kirthi.. -Yes, sir

560
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:40,379
Change my phone number.
Henceforth  I don’t want Priya’s letters to reach me.

561
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:51,285
You learnt a good lesson yesterday.

562
00:53:52,168 --> 00:53:53,898
Now you know how to behave with him.

563
00:53:53,985 --> 00:53:55,863
Don’t annoy me. -What?

564
00:53:56,953 --> 00:53:59,873
I said it. I’m gonna be in my limits.

565
00:54:00,018 --> 00:54:02,465
That’s exactly why don’t do things he doesn’t like.

566
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:03,505
Oh...!

567
00:54:03,753 --> 00:54:05,261
He doesn't like?

568
00:54:05,801 --> 00:54:08,480
Is that why he gets you to read that girl’s letters?

569
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:14,879
He refused to talk on the phone initially
and then spoke for hours in joy.

570
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:17,308
That’s exactly why we encouraged him to meet her.

571
00:54:17,857 --> 00:54:19,254
He didn’t meet her and blamed us.

572
00:54:20,353 --> 00:54:22,675
These rich guys are beyond my understanding.

573
00:54:24,665 --> 00:54:25,215
Tell me.

574
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,121
What?

575
00:54:29,473 --> 00:54:29,933
Did you see?

576
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:33,121
Where are you?

577
00:54:34,265 --> 00:54:34,730
I'm coming.

578
00:54:36,488 --> 00:54:38,347
What happened? -I’ll see you in an hour.

579
00:54:39,478 --> 00:54:40,269
Please inform him.

580
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:52,347
You would have missed the ceremony
if you got any late. -Who is he?

581
00:54:52,994 --> 00:54:54,847
Look at the guy behind the guy in brown.
He’s the groom.

582
00:55:06,855 --> 00:55:08,123
Who are you? What are you doing?

583
00:55:08,148 --> 00:55:08,957
What are you doing?

584
00:55:09,576 --> 00:55:11,576
Who are you? -Take your hand off him.

585
00:55:15,976 --> 00:55:17,144
Who are you?

586
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:21,168
Who are you to question him?

587
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:23,730
You wanna know who he is. Listen to it from me..

588
00:55:24,169 --> 00:55:26,769
He’ll be my husband in 10 minutes.

589
00:55:26,961 --> 00:55:29,105
Mother has big dreams about your wedding.

590
00:55:29,386 --> 00:55:31,098
She wont be able to take this.

591
00:55:31,169 --> 00:55:32,246
What do you want me to do now?

592
00:55:32,887 --> 00:55:35,175
What do I do? We pleaded his father.

593
00:55:35,634 --> 00:55:38,261
They enquired about our family. What do I tell them?

594
00:55:38,745 --> 00:55:44,185
That I have a brother who just got out of the prison?
Or about my rogue younger brother?

595
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:49,168
Who would accept a girl from such a family.

596
00:55:50,594 --> 00:55:55,050
Will his mother accept me?
Should I ruin my life because of you guys?

597
00:55:57,384 --> 00:55:59,746
Will you go talk his father?

598
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,785
Will you get an approval?

599
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:06,886
Look who’s talking!

600
00:56:08,211 --> 00:56:09,074
Sorry!

601
00:56:14,562 --> 00:56:15,363
I will talk!

602
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,290
You will talk? What will you talk?

603
00:56:21,713 --> 00:56:23,313
What will you talk?

604
00:56:23,457 --> 00:56:26,817
Swathi, he wants to give it a try.
Let him try.

605
00:56:28,113 --> 00:56:30,066
We’ve waited for so long. We’ll wait for some more time.

606
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:43,031
Hey, you’re here to talk about your sister.
Be careful.

607
00:56:43,096 --> 00:56:44,056
( Dog barking )

608
00:56:48,557 --> 00:56:49,266
Hello, sir.

609
00:56:49,671 --> 00:56:53,231
He’s our guy. -My sister...

610
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:54,555
Swathi..

611
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,648
Your son... -So, you’re the brother.

612
00:56:57,767 --> 00:56:58,447
Yes sir.

613
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:01,095
Was wondering why the dog was barking so much.

614
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,039
You went to the jail I believe.

615
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:06,399
What does your mother do?

616
00:57:08,413 --> 00:57:09,789
Railways... -Ah?

617
00:57:10,272 --> 00:57:11,242
She’s a clerk.

618
00:57:11,769 --> 00:57:13,883
Oh.. Security! -Sir.

619
00:57:14,814 --> 00:57:15,188
Sir.

620
00:57:15,593 --> 00:57:17,273
What’s your salary?
-Rs. 12,000 sir.

621
00:57:17,655 --> 00:57:17,914
Go..

622
00:57:18,215 --> 00:57:20,455
What’s your mother’s salary? 7000 or 8000?

623
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:24,024
That was a good move.

624
00:57:24,295 --> 00:57:28,335
To find one from such a family and depend on him.

625
00:57:30,008 --> 00:57:31,039
Whose plan was it?

626
00:57:31,495 --> 00:57:34,415
Your mother’s or yours?

627
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,766
You want to hit me?

628
00:57:42,278 --> 00:57:43,774
You are on parole I heard.

629
00:57:45,126 --> 00:57:48,672
One call and you’ll be back in the prison.

630
00:57:52,974 --> 00:57:58,574
Look, My dog also doesn’t like your presence.
How did you expect that I’ll accept your sister.

631
00:57:59,598 --> 00:58:01,758
Go away. -Let’s go.

632
00:58:03,434 --> 00:58:05,930
Sir, I’ve a small suggestion. -What?

633
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:09,441
The board outside reads beware of dog.

634
00:58:09,622 --> 00:58:11,582
Add the ‘S’ let it say beware of dogs.

635
00:58:11,648 --> 00:58:14,088
Hey, sit down.

636
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,899
Your pants are falling off.

637
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:26,219
Srinu.

638
00:58:27,568 --> 00:58:28,633
Srinu.. -Yes?

639
00:58:29,224 --> 00:58:31,047
What happened? -Nothing, brother.

640
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,797
Srinu, tell me what happened.

641
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,484
One must be born rich. Not like us.

642
00:58:39,913 --> 00:58:40,844
We can’t do anything.

643
00:58:41,647 --> 00:58:44,039
Love and relationships is only for the rich.

644
00:58:44,447 --> 00:58:45,578
Not for us.

645
00:58:47,264 --> 00:58:50,133
I stopped my sister’s wedding
because I'm scared for my mother.

646
00:58:52,015 --> 00:58:53,609
I went to talk to him.

647
00:58:54,744 --> 00:58:58,024
I couldn’t stop him
when he said things against my mother.

648
00:59:00,711 --> 00:59:04,102
My mother would be very upset
if my sister married without her knowledge.

649
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:11,016
Now I know who I am.

650
00:59:25,258 --> 00:59:26,492
Excuse me. -Sir?

651
00:59:26,936 --> 00:59:27,867
I need to meet Mr. Kaalidaas.

652
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:29,516
I don’t care what you do. -Ok sir.

653
00:59:30,084 --> 00:59:31,836
Sir Prasad Rao..

654
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:35,513
I’d have been there on order.
-I need to talk to you for 5 minutes.

655
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,156
Please come.

656
00:59:37,062 --> 00:59:39,227
Vikram has a message for you. -Tell me, sir.

657
00:59:50,592 --> 00:59:51,453
Now, you must take a call.

658
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:59,608
I need an hour from Mr. Vikramaditya. Please sir.

659
01:00:21,575 --> 01:00:22,313
Greetings, sister.

660
01:00:25,046 --> 01:00:25,875
May I come in?

661
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,760
My name is Kaalidas. I’m a small time entrepreneur.

662
01:00:38,207 --> 01:00:41,767
I’ll come straight to the point.
My son likes your daughter.

663
01:00:45,023 --> 01:00:48,125
He wanted to marry her but the girl wanted your approval.

664
01:00:51,823 --> 01:00:55,086
Now, I like your girl a lot.
Now that’s called moral upbringing.

665
01:00:56,430 --> 01:01:02,570
We can make money any time.
But good character is what a person is born with.

666
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,992
You just give a nod.

667
01:01:04,945 --> 01:01:09,445
I know it is important to consider their wish…
But our status doesn’t match yours…

668
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:12,208
What’s the big deal about status?
Every Tom, Dick and Harry has money these days.

669
01:01:12,312 --> 01:01:15,608
We shouldn’t think about these things.

670
01:01:15,734 --> 01:01:18,873
The girl and boy like each other. That’s all matters.

671
01:01:19,127 --> 01:01:21,063
Your daughter is now our daughter.

672
01:01:22,823 --> 01:01:25,594
Just give your consent.
I will take care of everything else.

673
01:01:26,104 --> 01:01:26,859
Is that a ‘yes’ from you?

674
01:01:31,602 --> 01:01:34,053
Okay, sister.  We’ll see you.
Drink some coffee.

675
01:01:34,078 --> 01:01:34,993
Come quickly, Swathi.

676
01:01:35,033 --> 01:01:37,153
I have an important meeting to attend in an hour.

677
01:01:37,544 --> 01:01:39,344
This is like my house.
I can join you for coffee at leisure.

678
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,125
See you again.

679
01:01:41,608 --> 01:01:42,203
Let's go..

680
01:01:43,301 --> 01:01:44,531
Swathi See them off.

681
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:53,203
Swathi, my child..

682
01:01:54,054 --> 01:01:55,320
Are you happy now? -Yes.

683
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:58,695
Can you call your brother
right away and tell him that?

684
01:02:01,074 --> 01:02:02,034
See you.

685
01:02:20,651 --> 01:02:21,097
Hello..

686
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:25,261
Swathi..

687
01:02:27,182 --> 01:02:28,386
I am sorry, brother.

688
01:02:32,024 --> 01:02:34,019
I never treated you like my brother.

689
01:02:36,102 --> 01:02:38,644
I’ve never given you the respect due to a brother.

690
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:45,743
I will never forget what you did for me today.

691
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,698
You’ve given me what I wished for.
Thank you, brother.

692
01:03:22,077 --> 01:03:23,527
Okay, go!

693
01:03:30,165 --> 01:03:32,913
You should’ve told me before itself that
you’re a close aide of Mr. Vikramaditya.

694
01:03:32,953 --> 01:03:35,353
I am here because of the subcontract
he sanctioned for me.

695
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:37,608
I spoke a little too much. Please don’t mind.

696
01:03:37,656 --> 01:03:41,816
I spoke to your mother.
Swathi will lead a very happy life. Forget about her.

697
01:03:41,912 --> 01:03:42,524
I’ll see you.

698
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,501
Please don’t take anything to your heart.

699
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:00,774
What’s all this, bro?

700
01:04:02,392 --> 01:04:05,821
If I’m your brother. She’s also my sister.

701
01:04:11,712 --> 01:04:14,665
Just a second. It’s brother calling. What’s up, brother?

702
01:04:15,071 --> 01:04:17,008
Swathi, is mother happy?

703
01:04:17,134 --> 01:04:18,171
Listen to her yourself.

704
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:20,968
Yes, I'm happy.. Ok sister.

705
01:04:21,241 --> 01:04:24,530
Aunt, Swathi’s marriage has been fixed.

706
01:04:25,272 --> 01:04:26,671
They are very rich family.

707
01:04:28,248 --> 01:04:31,241
You said we’d never get a good match for her.
Look what has happened now.

708
01:04:32,072 --> 01:04:35,695
Can I talk to uncle? Pass on the phone.
He’ll get mad that I didn’t tell him.

709
01:04:36,158 --> 01:04:39,601
Uncle, your grand-daughter belongs to a rich family now.

710
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,562
She’s very lucky.

711
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,515
I was so worried about her wedding.

712
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:48,265
By the blessings of almighty, I’m free of that now, uncle.

713
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:51,421
You guys must come a couple of days before the wedding.

714
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:55,768
Don’t complain later. Alright then, I’ll talk to you later. Bye.

715
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,273
Heard that?

716
01:05:00,353 --> 01:05:00,874
Yes.

717
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:05,663
Please don’t let mother know what happened yesterday.

718
01:05:06,352 --> 01:05:07,132
Okay, brother.

719
01:05:27,759 --> 01:05:30,249
Since my childhood I only saw my mother suffer.

720
01:05:31,573 --> 01:05:34,616
For the first time I can sense happiness from her.

721
01:05:37,318 --> 01:05:38,460
It’s all because of you, brother.

722
01:05:57,224 --> 01:05:58,538
Srinu. -Yeah?

723
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:01,570
Where are you going?
It’s my sister’s wedding.

724
01:06:02,702 --> 01:06:06,280
I want to make money for the arrangements.
I’ll go make a few paintings.

725
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,793
I must hire another Prasad to sell your paintings?

726
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:41,988
Shut the door.

727
01:06:43,823 --> 01:06:44,691
Shut the door.

728
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:50,399
Lock? -I meant that.

729
01:06:53,462 --> 01:06:54,590
God’s there!

730
01:06:57,111 --> 01:07:00,027
you must do something for me.

731
01:07:01,558 --> 01:07:04,785
I am not used to it.

732
01:07:05,878 --> 01:07:07,887
But I’ll try doing whatever you say.

733
01:07:08,168 --> 01:07:11,027
But not now, Later in the evening.

734
01:07:11,575 --> 01:07:15,488
I can’t wait until evening. -I can’t wait either.

735
01:07:15,863 --> 01:07:17,230
But we don’t have a choice.

736
01:07:20,405 --> 01:07:22,565
But brother will be there in the evening, right?
-yes, he’ll be there.

737
01:07:22,855 --> 01:07:26,055
He’s the main person, right?
-If he’s main. What am I ?

738
01:07:26,207 --> 01:07:27,967
You’ll be there right next to him, right.

739
01:07:29,918 --> 01:07:32,358
Me and brother together. No way.

740
01:07:32,509 --> 01:07:35,228
But you’ll have to cut his cake, right?

741
01:07:36,422 --> 01:07:39,540
Cake? -Hey, Don’t you know that it’s his birthday today?

742
01:07:40,206 --> 01:07:44,046
Birthday? -We’ve planned a surprise
birthday party at a hotel this evening.

743
01:07:44,191 --> 01:07:46,869
You should bring him there without his knowledge.

744
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:49,205
Please, he must not know.

745
01:07:51,431 --> 01:07:54,913
You wanted to shut the door for this?

746
01:07:55,094 --> 01:07:57,734
Yes, its a surprise. Not one must know.

747
01:08:00,007 --> 01:08:01,775
What were you thinking?

748
01:08:02,832 --> 01:08:04,165
A lot of things.

749
01:08:05,328 --> 01:08:08,848
I thought the surprise was for me.

750
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,560
Leave!

751
01:08:13,015 --> 01:08:14,935
True that.. -Go look into the arrangements.

752
01:08:18,215 --> 01:08:19,495
There’s no Almighty!

753
01:08:26,807 --> 01:08:28,243
Hey, where are you going?

754
01:08:29,006 --> 01:08:30,446
There’s too much traffic. I’ll take a shortcut.

755
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,430
So, there’s a surprise party?

756
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:38,649
What are you talking about?
She told you everything?

757
01:08:39,221 --> 01:08:40,305
She just can’t keep a secret.

758
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:46,580
Since 5 years they’ve been thinking
that they surprise me.

759
01:08:47,968 --> 01:08:49,783
And I keep acting like I actually am.

760
01:08:50,665 --> 01:08:52,540
Oh, brother!

761
01:08:53,243 --> 01:08:54,564
What’s the surprise?

762
01:08:55,495 --> 01:08:56,978
You will know. Let’s go.

763
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:02,488
Happy birthday! Surprise.

764
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:04,384
Prasad! What a surprise.

765
01:09:05,658 --> 01:09:09,528
Srinu, even you are surprised, right?
-Beyond words.

766
01:09:09,553 --> 01:09:13,073
You’ve seen nothing. The surprise is still there.
-What’s it, sir?

767
01:09:23,335 --> 01:09:24,774
Amazing! Amazing!

768
01:09:32,555 --> 01:09:33,689
Brother. -Uh?

769
01:09:33,894 --> 01:09:35,751
You’ve been celebrating your birthday like this for 5 years?

770
01:09:37,593 --> 01:09:39,205
Whose idea is this? -It’s my idea.

771
01:09:40,255 --> 01:09:40,970
Expected.

772
01:09:42,673 --> 01:09:46,736
What did you expect?
As a human one must have love towards art.

773
01:09:47,247 --> 01:09:49,392
What would you have done? -Sir?

774
01:09:49,673 --> 01:09:50,649
Silence.

775
01:09:51,694 --> 01:09:54,735
It’s okay to silent while praying. But a party?

776
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:09,525
Lakshmi, wake up!

777
01:10:13,848 --> 01:10:16,697
oh, no! -Turn on the lights!

778
01:10:16,766 --> 01:10:20,580
hey, lights on! -hello, there’s no echo!
You go ahead!

779
01:10:21,193 --> 01:10:24,073
one... one... -Who is that?

780
01:10:24,142 --> 01:10:26,153
2... 2... 2... -Who are you? Come down, I say!

781
01:10:26,201 --> 01:10:33,081
Hey sisters... this guys is being troublesome.
Please spare time with him.

782
01:10:33,273 --> 01:10:34,393
ey ey..!

783
01:10:35,095 --> 01:10:38,073
One who’d set the twin cities on fire...

784
01:10:38,228 --> 01:10:41,861
Here’s presenting the dancing peacock! -Steady!

785
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:46,103
Oops! Not a peacock! -Oh!

786
01:10:47,518 --> 01:10:53,678
Watch all the fun here. Have fun, boy! Music!

787
01:14:24,279 --> 01:14:25,713
Do you want to have a drink?

788
01:14:25,847 --> 01:14:28,887
Doctors advised otherwise, Srinu!
-Not again, brother.

789
01:14:29,662 --> 01:14:31,920
Srinu! -Uh?
Thanks!

790
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:34,483
But why? -You really surprised me.

791
01:14:36,666 --> 01:14:38,350
This is the best birthday I ever had!

792
01:14:38,543 --> 01:14:40,061
Stop it, brother!

793
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:42,936
Srinu! -Ah?

794
01:14:46,302 --> 01:14:47,733
What’s the peacock’s name?

795
01:14:48,553 --> 01:14:49,748
Hahaha.. -Hahaha..

796
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,367
Did anyone hear that? Hahaha..

797
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:09,889
Good night, brother.

798
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:12,928
Srinu.

799
01:15:14,975 --> 01:15:19,725
You’ll never leave me, right?
-I’ll never go until you ask me to.

800
01:15:21,536 --> 01:15:22,256
Good night.

801
01:16:19,062 --> 01:16:20,108
Good morning, brother!

802
01:16:21,804 --> 01:16:23,568
It’s too late already, wake up!

803
01:16:25,766 --> 01:16:27,904
Brother.. brother...

804
01:16:41,799 --> 01:16:45,159
Brother.. brother...

805
01:16:45,713 --> 01:16:49,433
Brother.. brother...

806
01:16:50,873 --> 01:16:52,793
Brother!

807
01:18:22,053 --> 01:18:23,075
It’s nothing but stress.

808
01:18:23,758 --> 01:18:26,848
When we are stressed, we have number of things to do.

809
01:18:27,413 --> 01:18:30,012
we go for a walk or jog...

810
01:18:30,648 --> 01:18:33,418
But it’s very tough for him
considering his physical condition.

811
01:18:34,465 --> 01:18:37,090
His body can’t take it, when he’s stressed.

812
01:18:37,549 --> 01:18:41,004
If this continues, it’s going be very difficult.

813
01:18:43,156 --> 01:18:45,458
It is tough to make him stress-free.

814
01:18:47,275 --> 01:18:50,450
It is a boon if you are able to forget things.
God hasn’t given him that boon.

815
01:18:51,267 --> 01:18:52,942
How is his health now? -He is alright now.

816
01:18:53,575 --> 01:18:56,122
We will observe him for a day
and discharge him tomorrow.

817
01:18:58,973 --> 01:19:01,122
Srinu, Drop me home.

818
01:19:08,293 --> 01:19:09,887
That’s a nice house. Is it yours?

819
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,300
No, I stole it from my neighbour. -I thought as much.

820
01:19:14,613 --> 01:19:16,200
You can leave now.

821
01:19:16,956 --> 01:19:17,825
Are you guys Telugu?

822
01:19:18,293 --> 01:19:19,934
I haven’t eaten anything from morning.
This is the first time I am coming home.

823
01:19:20,329 --> 01:19:21,293
Won’t you invite me in and serve me some food?

824
01:19:21,634 --> 01:19:22,661
I guessed right.

825
01:19:23,456 --> 01:19:25,629
You are definitely that villain in the tele-serial.

826
01:19:28,868 --> 01:19:29,239
Ok, come in.

827
01:19:32,137 --> 01:19:32,567
Sit down.

828
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:35,692
How is Vikram? -He is better.

829
01:19:44,388 --> 01:19:48,308
This painting… -It’s a beautiful painting, right?

830
01:19:48,887 --> 01:19:51,723
Vikram bought it for me. 2 Lakhs.

831
01:19:52,843 --> 01:19:54,161
What is the value you see in this painting?

832
01:19:56,451 --> 01:19:59,011
Do you know anything about painting and art?

833
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:04,239
To understand art and what the artist tries to convey,
you should not decipher it in your head.

834
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,545
But, feel it in your heart.

835
01:20:07,813 --> 01:20:09,004
So what does this artist convey to you?

836
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:13,989
Red denotes revolution and anger.

837
01:20:15,154 --> 01:20:18,965
Blue denotes the hope within us.

838
01:20:20,057 --> 01:20:21,926
Can you guess
why the artist has left most of it blank?

839
01:20:23,226 --> 01:20:24,731
Maybe he ran short of paint.

840
01:20:25,927 --> 01:20:27,927
That white space is the happiness within us.

841
01:20:29,945 --> 01:20:32,872
Do you see the specks of orange scattered here and there?

842
01:20:33,093 --> 01:20:34,989
Do you know what that means? -I don’t know.

843
01:20:35,773 --> 01:20:36,333
Love.

844
01:20:37,742 --> 01:20:38,426
Friendship

845
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:40,068
Beautiful.

846
01:20:40,271 --> 01:20:42,059
Can’t believe this painting conveys so much.

847
01:20:42,453 --> 01:20:44,606
Must be a great artist…

848
01:20:46,034 --> 01:20:46,856
Thank you.

849
01:20:47,813 --> 01:20:51,493
For what? -For helping me understand its meaning…

850
01:20:51,951 --> 01:20:54,489
It's okay, Beautiful.. Let’s go.

851
01:20:59,846 --> 01:21:01,075
This is imported liquor.

852
01:21:01,459 --> 01:21:03,997
No, I am not. -I don’t believe that.

853
01:21:04,022 --> 01:21:05,450
I am not used to having it with ice cubes.

854
01:21:21,848 --> 01:21:22,442
Sir.

855
01:21:23,605 --> 01:21:26,085
you were talking to the doctor
about brother’s stress or something.

856
01:21:26,344 --> 01:21:27,161
What is that, sir?

857
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:31,129
What do you know about Vikram?

858
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,668
He sits where you make him sit.
He eats what you feed.

859
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,733
He sleeps when you make him lie down. That’s all?

860
01:21:37,614 --> 01:21:39,801
He might be confined to a wheelchair now.

861
01:21:41,013 --> 01:21:46,693
But five years back it was different.
We had to zoom on wheels to catch up with him.

862
01:21:54,254 --> 01:21:58,610
You know what’s the first thing
I remember by his mention? Speed!

863
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:10,899
He loves car races and bike races,
Always up for some adventure.

864
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:17,571
He never knew what failure was. He always won.
Be it in business or a race, he always won.

865
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:19,555
That’s his quality.

866
01:22:20,589 --> 01:22:24,829
However stressed he maybe,
he always had that smile on his face.

867
01:22:30,694 --> 01:22:31,625
Who is this woman, sir?

868
01:22:32,996 --> 01:22:35,556
Nandini his one and only love.

869
01:22:36,038 --> 01:22:37,586
He was in madly love with her..

870
01:22:38,933 --> 01:22:39,922
They were about to get married.

871
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:42,985
What happened?

872
01:22:44,407 --> 01:22:47,414
He went to Europe for a business trip.
As usual, he was para-gliding....

873
01:22:48,413 --> 01:22:49,586
You know what’s para-gliding, right?

874
01:22:50,063 --> 01:22:53,423
You fly in the sky. That’s his favourite adventure.

875
01:22:53,573 --> 01:22:57,253
He fell off from 150 feet height.

876
01:22:57,856 --> 01:22:58,375
That's it.

877
01:22:59,573 --> 01:23:01,094
Both his cervical got damaged

878
01:23:02,133 --> 01:23:04,093
He went numb from his neck down.

879
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:05,188
Horrible.

880
01:23:07,493 --> 01:23:11,373
When he regained consciousness,
he wasn’t worried about his condition.

881
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:13,188
He was anxious about Nandhini.

882
01:23:15,422 --> 01:23:19,893
He felt it would be unfair
to get married to her and be a burden.

883
01:23:21,213 --> 01:23:23,973
He made me lie to her that
he wasn’t interested in getting married to her.

884
01:23:25,692 --> 01:23:28,313
He underwent treatment in Europe for six months.

885
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:30,914
He never tried meeting her again.

886
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:35,658
He let go of her thinking that it was the best for her.

887
01:23:36,026 --> 01:23:39,866
He constantly thinks about her well being and happiness.

888
01:23:41,577 --> 01:23:48,094
How much ever he tries to forget his past...
it keeps coming back to him like this.

889
01:23:49,417 --> 01:23:52,204
He was so well. Just can’t see him in this condition.

890
01:23:54,421 --> 01:23:55,907
Nothing must happen to him, sir.

891
01:23:57,435 --> 01:23:59,289
God can never keep anyone happy.

892
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:01,157
He gets his entertainment from people.

893
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:06,110
He keeps troubling people for fun, sir.

894
01:24:07,116 --> 01:24:08,032
He’s a bad boy!

895
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:12,907
Now I accept that you’re Telugu.

896
01:24:13,781 --> 01:24:15,118
You are very emotional.

897
01:24:16,329 --> 01:24:21,289
You told me so many facts when I asked.
Despite you not asking, I want to tell you one fact, sir.

898
01:24:23,093 --> 01:24:25,333
I would not be at peace otherwise. -What is that?

899
01:24:26,813 --> 01:24:30,053
I painted that.

900
01:24:35,097 --> 01:24:37,737
I never knew my painting had
so much meaning until you told me.

901
01:24:38,925 --> 01:24:42,789
But thanks for understanding and buying it.
I’ll see you, sir!

902
01:24:57,615 --> 01:24:58,575
Good morning.

903
01:24:59,399 --> 01:25:01,539
Vikram, How are you feeling now?

904
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,480
Much better. -You’ll be discharged today.

905
01:25:05,068 --> 01:25:07,430
There are a couple of medicines
that you have to take for a month.

906
01:25:07,646 --> 01:25:09,606
Who is looking after your medication?

907
01:25:13,887 --> 01:25:14,954
What is this? -Sir.

908
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,780
The body might be taking
the medicines but not the heart.

909
01:25:20,443 --> 01:25:21,883
So many medicines for stress?

910
01:25:22,862 --> 01:25:25,822
Some alcohol at night and all
the stress disappears by morning.

911
01:25:27,014 --> 01:25:29,322
You once told me that you
go to some place when you are stressed.

912
01:25:29,799 --> 01:25:30,353
Which place is that?

913
01:25:31,064 --> 01:25:31,864
Paris.

914
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:33,517
Paris.

915
01:25:33,966 --> 01:25:34,954
Can we go to Paris?

916
01:25:35,768 --> 01:25:36,525
Have you gone crazy?

917
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,681
How can he go when he is in this condition?

918
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:41,384
Paris, Are you planning the trip for him
or for yourself?

919
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:42,556
I don’t care what you think.

920
01:25:43,643 --> 01:25:48,043
You would have been to Paris many times.
But this is my only chance. Can I tag along with you?

921
01:25:50,053 --> 01:25:54,181
Ok, I’ve missed seeing a lot of things in my life.
I will add one more to my list now.

922
01:25:54,206 --> 01:25:57,726
That’s enough of over-acting!
We can’t take it.

923
01:25:58,421 --> 01:25:58,962
Prasad.

924
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:04,900
Didn’t you tell me that Srinu is on parole?

925
01:26:05,766 --> 01:26:09,384
Take care of those formalities. We are going to Paris.

926
01:26:37,741 --> 01:26:38,978
How much does a ticket to Paris cost?

927
01:26:39,943 --> 01:26:41,126
This is our plane.

928
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:44,408
You make it sound so normal.

929
01:28:03,032 --> 01:28:04,680
Such a beautiful city, Srinu.

930
01:28:07,973 --> 01:28:10,430
I agree. Very beautiful!

931
01:28:10,703 --> 01:28:13,235
Paris, City of love.

932
01:28:15,584 --> 01:28:16,469
Full of love…

933
01:28:18,305 --> 01:28:19,982
Good morning sir. -Good morning.

934
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,173
Why are you so beautiful?

935
01:28:21,478 --> 01:28:22,016
What?

936
01:28:22,286 --> 01:28:25,430
Brother was mentioning that Paris is beautiful. Right?

937
01:28:25,685 --> 01:28:26,565
Yes.

938
01:28:28,446 --> 01:28:29,126
Sir..

939
01:28:29,256 --> 01:28:31,896
I sat up all night and made the best plan to see Paris.

940
01:28:32,173 --> 01:28:35,008
Ten o’clock is the best town to see. -Eifel Tower!

941
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:38,337
After that we can go to... -Louvre Museum...

942
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:40,383
And then we go to the music street.

943
01:28:40,885 --> 01:28:43,219
And finally to the romantic river cruise.

944
01:28:43,289 --> 01:28:44,129
Brother.

945
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:46,735
Have you worked as a guide here?

946
01:28:48,704 --> 01:28:50,063
I love Paris, Srinu.

947
01:28:54,999 --> 01:28:57,313
They’ve built such a huge cell phone tower.

948
01:28:58,222 --> 01:28:59,540
I don’t think they will ever have network issues.

949
01:28:59,721 --> 01:29:02,161
That is not a cell phone tower.
That’s Eiffel Tower.

950
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,200
Oh! They give a name even for cell phone towers.

951
01:29:07,822 --> 01:29:10,063
It's so beautiful sir.. - It is..

952
01:29:10,359 --> 01:29:11,359
Click a picture.

953
01:29:36,253 --> 01:29:37,595
Idiot. What are you doing?

954
01:29:37,791 --> 01:29:41,673
Don’t you want the tower in the background?
Just focus on me. That will do.

955
01:29:41,789 --> 01:29:44,001
If you wanted a picture of only yourself,
you’ve could have got one back home.

956
01:29:44,978 --> 01:29:46,142
What do you say, brother?

957
01:29:46,406 --> 01:29:49,366
Only if the tower’s in the picture will
she get lots of likes on facebook, right?

958
01:29:49,695 --> 01:29:50,189
That’s true.

959
01:29:50,507 --> 01:29:51,501
Some people will never understand.

960
01:30:33,992 --> 01:30:35,915
Srinu, let’s go!

961
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:47,207
One painting costs 50 Lakhs?

962
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,451
You might not get one for even 50 Crores.

963
01:30:51,465 --> 01:30:53,208
I must start painting here.

964
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:56,904
Srinu, let’s go!

965
01:30:59,669 --> 01:31:02,162
This is amazing. Let’s take a picture here.

966
01:31:02,496 --> 01:31:03,779
Give it to me. -Hey, that’s my phone.

967
01:31:05,335 --> 01:31:06,138
Brother, smile please.

968
01:31:07,185 --> 01:31:07,622
Brother.

969
01:31:22,693 --> 01:31:23,810
Kirthi... -Yes sir.

970
01:31:24,493 --> 01:31:26,021
We are leaving tomorrow. -What, brother?

971
01:31:28,461 --> 01:31:29,638
We are going back to India tomorrow.

972
01:31:30,013 --> 01:31:30,794
What happened, brother?

973
01:31:31,573 --> 01:31:35,576
You love Paris..
And now you want to go back?

974
01:31:38,423 --> 01:31:39,779
I don’t like myself, Srinu.

975
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:43,787
For the first time I am missing myself.

976
01:31:46,885 --> 01:31:49,419
When you said Paris, I was very excited.

977
01:31:50,478 --> 01:31:51,896
I thought I’ll find myself.

978
01:31:55,548 --> 01:31:57,005
But I just realised...

979
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:01,177
That Vikram is no more.

980
01:32:02,318 --> 01:32:03,240
I can never find him again.

981
01:32:05,502 --> 01:32:06,935
But one thing is true.

982
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:11,966
I realise that the heart doesn’t follow you
wherever you go.

983
01:32:40,324 --> 01:32:41,924
Idiot! Stop the car.

984
01:32:45,363 --> 01:32:47,099
Srinu, Don’t let them go.

985
01:32:51,332 --> 01:32:52,513
Overtake that car.

986
01:33:26,419 --> 01:33:27,622
Change the gear.

987
01:33:41,003 --> 01:33:42,060
You want to play with us?

988
01:33:42,943 --> 01:33:48,138
Lets, go. -Press the brake and then accelerate.

989
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:59,146
Kirthi, wear your seat belt.

990
01:35:41,323 --> 01:35:42,013
Srinu, Right.

991
01:35:55,391 --> 01:35:56,255
Go, srinu.

992
01:36:52,291 --> 01:36:54,322
Shift the gear and accelerate.

993
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:01,523
Srinu, let’s go see Paris now.

994
01:40:00,056 --> 01:40:00,745
Wow!

995
01:40:30,844 --> 01:40:34,627
5 years ago... I met with an accident right here.

996
01:40:38,713 --> 01:40:42,392
In just a second my life became a memory.

997
01:40:45,651 --> 01:40:47,491
Why remember all that now, brother. Let’s go!

998
01:40:51,426 --> 01:40:52,994
Srinu.. -Brother.

999
01:40:53,458 --> 01:40:54,345
I want to fly!

1000
01:40:55,905 --> 01:40:56,533
What?

1001
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,978
I want to fly!

1002
01:41:02,953 --> 01:41:04,681
Don't worry, I am doing good.

1003
01:41:05,842 --> 01:41:07,642
This is madness. What are you doing..?

1004
01:41:07,823 --> 01:41:10,963
You should have denied, right?
-Let him do whatever he wants to do.

1005
01:41:13,099 --> 01:41:13,830
What is it?

1006
01:41:15,443 --> 01:41:18,243
No No.. Hey, leave me!

1007
01:41:18,575 --> 01:41:21,345
no no .. brother!

1008
01:41:21,564 --> 01:41:23,228
Even though your limbs don’t function..
everyone is looking at you.

1009
01:41:23,387 --> 01:41:25,509
I am perfectly alright. No one is looking at me.
No, brother. No!

1010
01:41:26,314 --> 01:41:28,720
You can tell him, right? Go, tell him!

1011
01:41:29,444 --> 01:41:31,619
Let him do whatever he wants to do.

1012
01:41:33,404 --> 01:41:36,338
That’s how you’re giving back to me? Tell him!

1013
01:41:55,714 --> 01:41:58,588
Hey.. No.. I'm a virgin, there is a lot see..

1014
01:42:08,843 --> 01:42:12,283
Hey.. I'll get heart attack please leave me.

1015
01:42:22,305 --> 01:42:23,572
Looks like he’s having fun!

1016
01:42:34,219 --> 01:42:36,353
What’s that sound? What’s with the fear?

1017
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,470
Don’t laugh loud, brother. Kirthi can hear you.

1018
01:42:40,072 --> 01:42:43,767
I was very strong until now. It’s all over now, brother.

1019
01:42:43,995 --> 01:42:47,555
You were trying to impress her for three months.
Did she ever look at you?

1020
01:42:47,843 --> 01:42:50,883
No, brother. I never took it seriously.

1021
01:42:50,973 --> 01:42:52,698
Are you scared of taking it seriously?

1022
01:42:52,738 --> 01:42:54,178
Scared about what? -Then, go tell her.

1023
01:42:54,556 --> 01:42:55,596
I will...

1024
01:42:57,163 --> 01:42:58,191
I’ll propose to her with a flower.

1025
01:43:11,765 --> 01:43:12,824
Ki.. Kirthi..

1026
01:43:14,228 --> 01:43:14,769
What?

1027
01:43:16,123 --> 01:43:17,730
What’s with the flower?

1028
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:22,980
The flower dried up. Thought I’ll change.

1029
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:27,472
Are you working?

1030
01:43:28,394 --> 01:43:30,566
Nope. I’m sleeping. -Okay, sleep well.

1031
01:43:36,984 --> 01:43:40,184
I was so confident when I went.

1032
01:43:41,003 --> 01:43:44,683
But my heart started beating
so fast when I went closer.

1033
01:43:44,811 --> 01:43:46,731
That’s called fear, Srinu.

1034
01:43:47,466 --> 01:43:49,402
Where there’s love, there’s fear.

1035
01:43:50,923 --> 01:43:54,035
Fear of rejection.

1036
01:43:55,619 --> 01:43:58,214
Fear of loss after acceptance.

1037
01:44:00,405 --> 01:44:05,167
Fear of moving apart.

1038
01:44:08,738 --> 01:44:10,769
Truly, where there’s fear, there’s love.

1039
01:44:12,147 --> 01:44:15,792
Your thought is so profound.

1040
01:44:17,123 --> 01:44:18,870
Once upon a time you were a romantic, right?

1041
01:44:19,474 --> 01:44:20,792
Even now!

1042
01:44:23,681 --> 01:44:27,636
Even now? You’re drunk. Let’s go!

1043
01:44:28,883 --> 01:44:30,839
You won't believe me? -Nope.

1044
01:44:32,043 --> 01:44:32,902
Try me!

1045
01:44:35,123 --> 01:44:38,963
Pick up a girl. I’ll make her fall for me in two days.

1046
01:44:39,930 --> 01:44:40,949
Pick one.

1047
01:44:57,683 --> 01:44:58,527
What’s the bet?

1048
01:45:00,465 --> 01:45:03,345
What if she falls for me in two days? What’s the bet?

1049
01:45:04,706 --> 01:45:05,697
You decide!

1050
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:09,645
If she falls for me in two days..
you must disclose your feelings to kirthi.

1051
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:13,940
If she falls for you. Done. Let’s see.

1052
01:46:01,752 --> 01:46:04,088
Brother! he’s here.
Where do I send him again?

1053
01:46:05,312 --> 01:46:07,423
Give him some money and ask him to leave.

1054
01:46:10,201 --> 01:46:15,150
Thanks for the bike, brother. We are now done.
How do I tell that in his language?

1055
01:46:17,883 --> 01:46:20,766
Je t’aime.  Serre moi. Embrazze moi!

1056
01:46:24,385 --> 01:46:27,836
You think I cant say it?
I will do it, wait and see.

1057
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:32,578
He’ll just say it. -Let him.

1058
01:46:32,968 --> 01:46:36,133
Je t’aime.  Serre moi. Embrazze moi!

1059
01:46:42,133 --> 01:46:43,438
Why are you holding my hand?

1060
01:46:44,549 --> 01:46:47,141
Your work is done. Leave.
Why are you falling on me?

1061
01:46:48,828 --> 01:46:50,899
I’m not that kind of a guy.

1062
01:46:53,606 --> 01:46:54,587
Don't allow him.

1063
01:46:58,471 --> 01:47:00,954
Why is he falling on me
when I asked him to leave?

1064
01:47:02,033 --> 01:47:05,727
You said.. you loved him and asked him to hug and kiss.

1065
01:47:06,026 --> 01:47:06,899
Me?

1066
01:47:10,637 --> 01:47:12,237
What’s this, brother?

1067
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,470
Go away!

1068
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,509
Will she come, brother?

1069
01:47:26,257 --> 01:47:27,345
For sure..

1070
01:47:28,274 --> 01:47:30,829
Will girls come on sending that flower?
You are too much!

1071
01:47:31,173 --> 01:47:32,803
I didn’t send her flowers.

1072
01:47:32,913 --> 01:47:34,673
Curiosity. - what?

1073
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:37,400
Curiosity.

1074
01:47:38,826 --> 01:47:39,774
I don’t believe it.

1075
01:47:48,062 --> 01:47:49,024
She’s here.

1076
01:47:50,409 --> 01:47:52,852
Curiosity is here. -Why are you still here? Leave!

1077
01:48:00,204 --> 01:48:02,595
You knew she was coming?
You are waiting at the right place.

1078
01:48:06,803 --> 01:48:07,313
Jenny.

1079
01:48:08,976 --> 01:48:09,907
You're looking for me?

1080
01:48:10,810 --> 01:48:12,556
Vikram! -Ya it's me.

1081
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:23,700
Is it you who sent me the flowers? -Yeah.

1082
01:48:24,073 --> 01:48:24,913
But why?

1083
01:48:25,163 --> 01:48:27,483
Beauty not admired is a sin.

1084
01:48:28,745 --> 01:48:29,595
You’re beautiful.

1085
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,431
Hello, subtitles!

1086
01:48:32,843 --> 01:48:33,470
What?

1087
01:48:34,106 --> 01:48:36,642
What’s the girl saying?
-She asked why he sent the flowers?

1088
01:48:37,088 --> 01:48:39,908
What did brother say?
-Beauty not admired is a sin.

1089
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:41,720
You’re beautiful.

1090
01:48:42,426 --> 01:48:44,017
This is exactly what I wanted to say.

1091
01:48:45,790 --> 01:48:47,243
Why did you send me flowers?

1092
01:48:47,401 --> 01:48:49,095
I want to go out on a date with you.

1093
01:48:49,544 --> 01:48:50,829
A date? -Yeah.

1094
01:48:52,905 --> 01:48:54,954
With you? -Don’t go by the looks.

1095
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:56,869
Looks can be deceiving.

1096
01:48:57,264 --> 01:49:00,144
What if I say no? -Think before you say no.

1097
01:49:00,769 --> 01:49:03,486
You just might miss
one of the most beautiful day in your life.

1098
01:49:08,134 --> 01:49:10,775
It’s amazing. You know what he said...

1099
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:13,759
The girl laughed. She’s fallen for him.
The game is over!

1100
01:49:44,368 --> 01:49:45,697
Hello.. Hello..

1101
01:49:45,908 --> 01:49:47,814
Why do you want to disturb them. Let’s go.

1102
01:49:48,008 --> 01:49:50,328
Why should I interrupt the two of you.

1103
01:49:50,938 --> 01:49:51,876
Two of us?

1104
01:49:59,816 --> 01:50:01,111
I can’t take it anymore.

1105
01:50:07,786 --> 01:50:09,478
Where were you hiding all these days, Jenny?

1106
01:50:11,162 --> 01:50:13,134
Never seen Sir so happy before.

1107
01:50:13,710 --> 01:50:17,390
How did you figure out that coming here
would make him so happy?

1108
01:50:19,149 --> 01:50:21,469
I didn’t know. My mother always said...

1109
01:50:21,693 --> 01:50:23,665
You’ll find where you lost.

1110
01:50:25,165 --> 01:50:27,565
He lost it all here. That’s why I got him here.

1111
01:50:34,376 --> 01:50:36,247
Is there a show happening here? -Ya.

1112
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:37,911
It's your show.

1113
01:50:39,292 --> 01:50:40,614
My show? -Yes.

1114
01:50:41,462 --> 01:50:43,715
Perfect day is not over without a dance.

1115
01:50:45,205 --> 01:50:46,270
Will you dance with me?

1116
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:49,083
Dance with you?

1117
01:50:50,751 --> 01:50:53,356
How is that possible? -Just dance with me.

1118
01:50:54,321 --> 01:50:57,364
Every breath and move you make, I'll be there with you.

1119
01:50:58,849 --> 01:51:00,614
Yes, It's a promise.

1120
01:52:51,415 --> 01:52:52,465
That was magical.

1121
01:52:53,694 --> 01:52:57,059
You're right,
It was one of the most beautiful days of my life.

1122
01:52:59,537 --> 01:53:00,097
Thank you.

1123
01:53:33,491 --> 01:53:34,348
Hmm..

1124
01:53:35,018 --> 01:53:38,578
You are like this today.
How were you before the incident?

1125
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:42,800
How can any girl come like that?
How can she laugh like that?

1126
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:46,330
How could she dance? The kisses... oh my!

1127
01:53:46,794 --> 01:53:49,554
You think I’ll forget the bet if you divert me?

1128
01:53:50,923 --> 01:53:52,254
What bet are you talking about?

1129
01:53:52,586 --> 01:53:54,075
You must go and talk to Kirthi.

1130
01:53:54,458 --> 01:53:55,887
It’s late. Sleep now. Good night!

1131
01:53:56,218 --> 01:53:57,378
You are not standing by your words.

1132
01:53:59,239 --> 01:54:00,723
I can’t talk like you, brother.

1133
01:54:00,866 --> 01:54:03,186
You must have thought about it
before accepting the challenge.

1134
01:54:04,403 --> 01:54:05,106
Srinu..

1135
01:54:05,915 --> 01:54:07,778
Just say whatever you have in your heart.

1136
01:54:09,443 --> 01:54:10,012
Go.

1137
01:54:11,839 --> 01:54:12,911
I’m going only because of you.

1138
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:15,903
Srinu..

1139
01:54:17,259 --> 01:54:18,942
You are forgetting the flower.

1140
01:54:32,501 --> 01:54:33,059
Kirthi..

1141
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:35,411
I need to talk to you...

1142
01:54:36,562 --> 01:54:37,778
Don’t turn around.

1143
01:54:38,283 --> 01:54:39,770
I might not be able to talk then.

1144
01:54:43,308 --> 01:54:44,372
I’ll tell you a truth.

1145
01:54:45,552 --> 01:54:47,270
I’m really scared of you.

1146
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:53,420
Because I can’t match up to you...

1147
01:54:54,064 --> 01:54:56,184
Don’t think about our compatibility.

1148
01:54:56,799 --> 01:55:00,223
Meenakshi and I complemented each other,
but that didn’t work out.. right?

1149
01:55:00,683 --> 01:55:03,661
That means we can work out.

1150
01:55:04,611 --> 01:55:09,504
But Meenakshi is not as great as you. You are hot!

1151
01:55:13,682 --> 01:55:14,168
See..

1152
01:55:15,323 --> 01:55:17,340
I feared talking like this.

1153
01:55:18,804 --> 01:55:22,731
But brother said where there’s fear, there’s love.

1154
01:55:25,931 --> 01:55:26,848
I am saying it...

1155
01:55:27,868 --> 01:55:28,723
I am saying it...

1156
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:32,254
I

1157
01:55:34,829 --> 01:55:35,450
Love

1158
01:55:37,388 --> 01:55:37,715
You.

1159
01:55:45,555 --> 01:55:46,161
Hey!

1160
01:55:47,377 --> 01:55:48,551
you didn’t scold me.

1161
01:55:49,908 --> 01:55:50,934
Is that a yes?

1162
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:10,354
Srinu..

1163
01:56:20,507 --> 01:56:22,791
Are you blind?

1164
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:25,556
Just because there is a girl in front of you,
will you not see the glass?

1165
01:56:26,094 --> 01:56:28,534
What an embarrassment?
How will you go back to India?

1166
01:56:38,683 --> 01:56:40,065
He is a pain.

1167
01:56:42,151 --> 01:56:42,955
Hey, Where are you?

1168
01:56:43,212 --> 01:56:44,268
Come out..

1169
01:56:44,817 --> 01:56:46,510
I’ve come to visit your country
and you give me flowers.

1170
01:56:47,956 --> 01:56:49,322
Flowers! who sent?
where is he?

1171
01:56:50,503 --> 01:56:53,854
Excuse me..  I am sorry.
I am sorry. You can go!

1172
01:56:55,413 --> 01:56:56,213
Why are you screaming?

1173
01:56:56,363 --> 01:56:58,401
Despite warning him, he sent me flowers.

1174
01:57:00,167 --> 01:57:01,767
Are you sure he sent you the flowers? -Then?

1175
01:57:02,107 --> 01:57:03,627
Who else will send flowers to me?

1176
01:57:03,783 --> 01:57:05,088
look at the flowers closely.

1177
01:57:17,487 --> 01:57:18,932
I wanted to give you the flower..

1178
01:57:22,412 --> 01:57:25,229
Then who kept the flowers? -I kept it there.

1179
01:57:26,662 --> 01:57:27,424
Does that mean you heard me?

1180
01:57:28,542 --> 01:57:29,229
Don’t ask me

1181
01:57:30,366 --> 01:57:33,330
I don’t know how I liked you.

1182
01:57:34,431 --> 01:57:38,924
But I know the one you love will remain happy forever.

1183
01:57:39,951 --> 01:57:41,588
I can see that in sir.

1184
01:57:43,058 --> 01:57:45,682
I need that. That’s why I like you.

1185
01:57:50,653 --> 01:57:51,244
Hey, wait!

1186
01:57:52,612 --> 01:57:56,244
Are you informing me or confirming it to me?

1187
01:58:00,683 --> 01:58:02,854
Hey. That smile!

1188
02:01:36,891 --> 02:01:38,274
Brother.. I'll be right back..

1189
02:01:44,717 --> 02:01:45,821
Brother! -Yeah?

1190
02:02:00,075 --> 02:02:00,579
Srinu!

1191
02:02:05,091 --> 02:02:05,594
Srinu!

1192
02:02:07,688 --> 02:02:08,298
Srinu come..

1193
02:02:28,916 --> 02:02:29,821
Srinu.

1194
02:02:48,810 --> 02:02:49,391
Vikram.

1195
02:02:59,011 --> 02:03:00,524
Are you running away from me?

1196
02:04:23,803 --> 02:04:27,403
When you left me, I didn’t suspect anything.

1197
02:04:28,386 --> 02:04:30,026
I believed we were in love.

1198
02:04:30,802 --> 02:04:33,082
That moment you went away is still fresh in mind.

1199
02:04:35,122 --> 02:04:40,642
I thought I should never see you
or think of you again.

1200
02:04:42,199 --> 02:04:43,782
But when I continued thinking of you..

1201
02:04:44,651 --> 02:04:48,790
I was angry with myself for falling in love
with a man like you.

1202
02:04:49,274 --> 02:04:52,298
I began to hate you. But a week back..

1203
02:04:54,970 --> 02:04:57,219
Srinu called me to tell me everything.

1204
02:05:11,243 --> 02:05:16,571
I wondered how I stayed happy despite
of having so much hatred in me

1205
02:05:19,557 --> 02:05:21,235
It was only after I spoke to Srinu

1206
02:05:23,193 --> 02:05:30,196
Your good wishes for me were way stronger
than my hatred towards you.

1207
02:05:32,178 --> 02:05:35,743
How, Vikram? How can you love someone so much?

1208
02:05:36,897 --> 02:05:40,457
These five years, You lost yourself for me.

1209
02:05:41,873 --> 02:05:44,048
You were worried about me, right?

1210
02:05:46,523 --> 02:05:49,782
You kept away from me because
you wanted us to be happy, right?

1211
02:05:51,913 --> 02:05:54,078
And you are leaving without seeing that happiness?

1212
02:06:10,610 --> 02:06:11,848
That’s my daughter Aadhya

1213
02:06:14,091 --> 02:06:15,442
And my husband Abhinav.

1214
02:06:19,447 --> 02:06:22,356
This is my family. My happiness.

1215
02:07:46,207 --> 02:07:48,324
Thanks, Vikram. Thanks for meeting me.

1216
02:07:48,829 --> 02:07:52,137
I’d have hated you for life hadn’t you met me.

1217
02:07:52,783 --> 02:07:58,063
You hope to love me and not have me.

1218
02:07:58,566 --> 02:08:05,856
As much as you want me to be happy,
I want you to be happier than that.

1219
02:08:06,269 --> 02:08:07,801
Hope you make my wish come true.

1220
02:08:29,236 --> 02:08:33,054
How are you? I have a scent bottle for you.
-Hi, vikram.

1221
02:08:33,583 --> 02:08:35,823
How are you, old man?
-Who is the old man?

1222
02:08:36,958 --> 02:08:39,015
I saw an excellent painting for you in Paris.

1223
02:08:41,549 --> 02:08:44,265
Of all the things you found
a painting for me in Paris?

1224
02:08:46,183 --> 02:08:47,383
Lakshmi. -Sir?

1225
02:08:47,596 --> 02:08:50,140
I’m tired of all the salads I had in the last 10 days.

1226
02:08:51,005 --> 02:08:52,765
Make me some yummy stew.

1227
02:08:56,069 --> 02:08:58,349
Just a second, sir.
Give me that plate...

1228
02:08:58,518 --> 02:09:01,687
Where did I keep the plate?
Not this one, give me a bowl for stew.

1229
02:09:01,805 --> 02:09:03,725
You washed it properly, right?

1230
02:09:04,192 --> 02:09:06,752
Give me some pepper and some coriander powder..
-Lakshmi.

1231
02:09:07,446 --> 02:09:08,640
Why are you in such a hurry?

1232
02:09:08,757 --> 02:09:12,437
It’s been 5 years.
He asked me something for the first time.

1233
02:09:12,623 --> 02:09:14,863
I don’t have time for this. I need to serve him stew.

1234
02:09:14,863 --> 02:09:16,523
Get me some tamarind.

1235
02:09:19,039 --> 02:09:22,007
Looks like you had a great holiday. -I met Nandini.

1236
02:09:41,006 --> 02:09:41,953
Srinu.

1237
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:46,172
Hi Sir, how have you been?

1238
02:09:46,623 --> 02:09:50,503
I asked him that day...
why did you choose him?

1239
02:09:51,912 --> 02:09:55,272
He said,
you were the right choice that moment.

1240
02:09:56,309 --> 02:09:57,945
I felt he was doing wrong.

1241
02:09:59,781 --> 02:10:00,789
But it’s my mistake.

1242
02:10:02,053 --> 02:10:05,453
I  saw him in this condition for
5 years and did nothing.

1243
02:10:06,223 --> 02:10:08,223
I told you about him for 5 minutes...

1244
02:10:09,204 --> 02:10:10,679
And you changed his life.

1245
02:10:12,525 --> 02:10:13,031
Thank you.

1246
02:10:14,703 --> 02:10:16,063
You’d never leave him, right?

1247
02:10:16,303 --> 02:10:19,297
Why would I leave a bathroom
and bedroom like this, sir.

1248
02:10:20,365 --> 02:10:21,820
Where would I go anyway.

1249
02:10:24,068 --> 02:10:25,804
I have a small doubt. -What’s that, sir?

1250
02:10:27,518 --> 02:10:28,273
Painting..

1251
02:10:30,096 --> 02:10:32,056
Did you really paint that? -You’re too much.

1252
02:10:32,199 --> 02:10:35,239
I trusted you and started another painting as well.
-Spare me, dude!

1253
02:10:35,587 --> 02:10:37,667
Sir! -Thank you very much.

1254
02:10:40,007 --> 02:10:42,882
Prasad knew that you painted that?
I told him, brother.

1255
02:10:42,907 --> 02:10:45,187
Srinu, Someone is here for you.

1256
02:10:45,654 --> 02:10:46,461
For me?

1257
02:11:09,017 --> 02:11:11,529
Who told you that I was here?

1258
02:11:12,821 --> 02:11:13,654
Sister told me.

1259
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:26,123
Hey open your mouth, where’s your son?

1260
02:11:27,670 --> 02:11:30,550
He has been booked under attempt to murder case.

1261
02:11:37,576 --> 02:11:40,599
Your son got drunk with his friends
and got into a fight at the bar.

1262
02:11:40,905 --> 02:11:43,665
Two of them are in the hospital.
They are fighting for their life.

1263
02:11:44,054 --> 02:11:46,014
We know that you know where he is.

1264
02:11:46,428 --> 02:11:48,115
He better surrender himself by morning.

1265
02:11:48,474 --> 02:11:51,318
But if we find him, you know what’s gonna happen.

1266
02:11:56,092 --> 02:11:56,810
What did you do?

1267
02:11:58,485 --> 02:11:59,388
Tell me what happened?

1268
02:12:00,134 --> 02:12:01,669
I didn’t do anything.

1269
02:12:02,645 --> 02:12:03,779
They were having a fight.

1270
02:12:04,431 --> 02:12:07,471
I was just there. I didn’t hit anyone.

1271
02:12:13,169 --> 02:12:14,584
Okay, sit here.

1272
02:12:26,910 --> 02:12:27,662
Just a minute, brother.

1273
02:12:29,810 --> 02:12:31,060
Swathi? – Brother..

1274
02:12:31,196 --> 02:12:32,826
He’s with me. I’ll look after this.

1275
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:35,091
You take care of mother.

1276
02:12:37,969 --> 02:12:40,896
This is exactly what I was worried the most about.

1277
02:12:42,502 --> 02:12:45,607
I lost one son already.. and now the other.

1278
02:12:46,984 --> 02:12:48,701
What have I done? -Mother.

1279
02:12:56,349 --> 02:12:57,771
Srinu! -What is it about?

1280
02:12:58,041 --> 02:13:00,005
You remembered us after a long time.

1281
02:13:00,864 --> 02:13:03,944
Kanna is in some problem. Take him to your village

1282
02:13:04,989 --> 02:13:08,013
He better not be seen in the city for at least 2 weeks.
-you’re coming, right?

1283
02:13:08,184 --> 02:13:09,794
You know I can’t go.

1284
02:13:11,141 --> 02:13:13,068
You come quickly. -Okay. Hey, bring the vehicle!

1285
02:13:16,552 --> 02:13:18,568
Do you want to sleep, brother?
-What happened, srinu?

1286
02:13:18,647 --> 02:13:20,727
Nothing much, brother. Just a small issue.
-Is he your brother?

1287
02:13:22,914 --> 02:13:24,994
Why bother about all that now?
Let’s hit the bed.

1288
02:13:25,751 --> 02:13:28,791
When you called me brother,
I thought you meant it.

1289
02:13:30,086 --> 02:13:34,263
But you hide a lot of things from me.
I don’t know.

1290
02:13:35,414 --> 02:13:36,037
Ok.

1291
02:13:41,426 --> 02:13:42,357
He is not my brother.

1292
02:13:45,479 --> 02:13:46,779
He is not my own brother.

1293
02:13:53,759 --> 02:13:57,560
Even the person I call my mother
is not the one who gave birth to me.

1294
02:14:07,768 --> 02:14:10,740
She is my mother’s sister.

1295
02:14:12,193 --> 02:14:15,153
When I was seven years old,
my parents died in an accident.

1296
02:14:16,585 --> 02:14:22,505
When everyone wanted to send me to an orphanage,
my aunt said she would raise me.

1297
02:14:23,713 --> 02:14:25,630
My sister and brother were born later.

1298
02:14:26,646 --> 02:14:31,279
After my uncle died,
my mother had a tough time raising all of us.

1299
02:14:31,842 --> 02:14:36,362
When I saw her struggling,
I would think I was an added burden to her.

1300
02:14:37,816 --> 02:14:38,990
I thought I would ease her troubles
by not going to school.

1301
02:14:39,528 --> 02:14:41,841
When she questioned me I didn’t say anything.

1302
02:14:43,096 --> 02:14:46,056
Ever since, we quarrelled a lot.

1303
02:14:46,443 --> 02:14:48,232
I wanted to do a lot for her...

1304
02:14:48,701 --> 02:14:51,271
I wanted to earn a lot of money to give her.

1305
02:14:52,037 --> 02:14:53,771
But I didn’t know how to earn it.

1306
02:14:54,893 --> 02:14:57,613
That’s why I started stealing.

1307
02:14:58,185 --> 02:14:59,169
She said me to get out of the house

1308
02:14:59,388 --> 02:15:04,646
I want to make money for her happiness
and not for myself.

1309
02:15:06,263 --> 02:15:07,974
But she never understood me.

1310
02:15:09,821 --> 02:15:11,599
She’s blaming me even now.

1311
02:15:16,999 --> 02:15:22,639
If money brings happiness,
I should be the happiest man in this universe, Srinu.

1312
02:15:25,105 --> 02:15:30,552
I needed a man who was just out of jail
to show me what happiness was.

1313
02:15:32,704 --> 02:15:35,974
Do you know where your happiness lies?

1314
02:15:37,381 --> 02:15:38,185
It’s with your mother.

1315
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:43,412
You want to be close to your mother,
but you are distancing yourself from her.

1316
02:15:45,455 --> 02:15:46,115
Go away, srinu.

1317
02:15:50,353 --> 02:15:52,763
You can’t live alongside a wheelchair all your life, right?

1318
02:15:54,638 --> 02:15:58,185
Your mother needs you more than me.

1319
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:04,685
You gave so much to a complete stranger like me...
imagine what you can do for your mother.

1320
02:16:06,272 --> 02:16:10,810
You must find where you lost, srinu.

1321
02:16:28,216 --> 02:16:30,724
I’ll be there in 5 minutes. Bring kanna outside.

1322
02:16:31,304 --> 02:16:34,559
You leave. I’m going home now.

1323
02:17:49,011 --> 02:17:50,052
Sir is calling.. come.

1324
02:18:04,102 --> 02:18:05,989
Take your brother and go home.

1325
02:19:14,450 --> 02:19:15,058
He is my son.

1326
02:19:15,279 --> 02:19:19,439
I know, it is because of him that
we are talking about marriage.

1327
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:27,754
I'm here to talk about the marriage preparation.
-One minute.

1328
02:19:31,323 --> 02:19:34,848
Let’s fix upon a date and time
for the wedding proceedings.

1329
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:39,957
You can talk to my son about it.

1330
02:19:42,768 --> 02:19:43,941
We’ll approve to whatever he says.

1331
02:20:21,553 --> 02:20:23,033
I don’t want anything. Take it off.

1332
02:20:23,713 --> 02:20:25,353
I said I don’t want anything. Go away!

1333
02:20:31,959 --> 02:20:33,578
Did you call me, sir? -Take me out.

1334
02:20:33,981 --> 02:20:35,301
Doctors advised otherwise, sir.

1335
02:20:36,119 --> 02:20:36,563
Go away!

1336
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:41,930
Shall I call Srinu?

1337
02:20:44,337 --> 02:20:44,883
No.

1338
02:20:46,150 --> 02:20:50,383
Let him live his life. Don’t disturb him.

1339
02:21:25,993 --> 02:21:30,039
Tell me, sir..
-Can you meet Vikram?

1340
02:21:30,199 --> 02:21:30,883
Of course, sir..

1341
02:21:34,711 --> 02:21:35,321
What happened, sir?

1342
02:21:37,477 --> 02:21:40,488
I thought he’d miss nothing in life after the Paris trip.

1343
02:21:40,536 --> 02:21:42,856
But he’s missing life after you left.

1344
02:21:44,073 --> 02:21:45,360
He asked me not to call you..

1345
02:21:46,402 --> 02:21:48,149
But I got scared looking at his condition.

1346
02:21:49,064 --> 02:21:49,461
Go...

1347
02:21:58,477 --> 02:21:59,094
Brother..

1348
02:22:18,429 --> 02:22:21,629
What’s this, brother?
Why do you look like heartbroken kid?

1349
02:22:25,328 --> 02:22:26,118
Srinu..

1350
02:22:27,797 --> 02:22:31,188
I’m unable to breathe here. Let’s go out.

1351
02:23:16,732 --> 02:23:17,547
What do we do now?

1352
02:23:19,894 --> 02:23:20,938
Let me decide that.

1353
02:24:05,714 --> 02:24:06,717
See..

1354
02:24:09,511 --> 02:24:13,327
Just the hat and you’ll look like Quickgun Murugan.
-It doesn’t look good.

1355
02:24:19,358 --> 02:24:23,819
You look like a villain from Bruce Lee’s movies.
-Are you playing around with me?

1356
02:24:24,096 --> 02:24:25,163
It’s been long, right?

1357
02:24:36,193 --> 02:24:38,459
You look like Cupid now.

1358
02:24:38,976 --> 02:24:41,376
What will happen to the girls
if you grow your beard?

1359
02:24:43,791 --> 02:24:47,702
I was a plain sheet of paper.
You turned me into a painting.

1360
02:24:49,127 --> 02:24:51,687
When you asked me to go with my mother,
I was scared.

1361
02:24:52,176 --> 02:24:54,686
But when I was with her I realised..

1362
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:57,577
You don’t need money to live.

1363
02:24:58,628 --> 02:25:01,210
Even one soul who loves you is enough
to get you through life.

1364
02:25:03,119 --> 02:25:07,600
What you need now is not an attender
who wipes away your tears.

1365
02:25:07,974 --> 02:25:10,108
But a companion
who does not let you shed tears.

1366
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:13,046
That day you asked me to leave.

1367
02:25:14,219 --> 02:25:15,124
I am leaving now.

1368
02:25:24,189 --> 02:25:25,608
You can’t escape from here now.

1369
02:25:27,461 --> 02:25:29,311
Your hands and legs don’t move.

1370
02:25:30,302 --> 02:25:31,679
Your heart’s still beating.

1371
02:25:33,861 --> 02:25:34,874
Don’t stop it.

1372
02:25:39,518 --> 02:25:40,335
Hey, Srinu!

1373
02:25:41,334 --> 02:25:41,749
Srinu!

1374
02:25:42,663 --> 02:25:43,163
Srinu.

1375
02:26:31,348 --> 02:26:32,491
How are you, Vikram?
